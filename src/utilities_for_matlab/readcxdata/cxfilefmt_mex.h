// cxfilefmt_mex.h :  Data structs defining format of data records in Maestro/Cntrlx trial- and cont-mode data files.
//
// AUTHOR:  saruffner, sglisberger, et al.
//
// DESCRIPTION:
// This is a modified version of the Maestro source code header file CXFILEFMT.H.  It is required to build the MATLAB
// MEX function readcxdata(), which is used to read Maestro and Cntrlx data files into the MATLAB environment.
// MATLAB's MEX tool uses the GNU CC compiler; while GCC can handle C++ source code files, MEX handles only C files.
//
// It is the "const <type> IDENTIFIER = <value>" syntax that caused problems with the MEX build.  While such a constant
// definition is acceptable when <value> is a constant, it introduces several problems down the line:
//    1) The compiler cannot handle "const <type> IDENTIFIER = <constant identifier>" when <constant identifier> was
//       defined using the above syntax.  Here we must replace <constant identifer> with a constant literal or a
//       #define'd constant name.
//    2) Any constant defined using the above syntax CANNOT be used to indicate the dimensions of an array declared
//       outside a function.  Nor can they be used in "case <constant>" expressions within a "switch" clause.  We must
//       define these constants using the #define construct.
//
// Thus, I've replaced all "const <type> IDENTIFIER = <value>" constructs with "#define IDENTIFIER <value>" throughout
// this file.  I also commented out an #if-endif preprocessor clause specific to MS VC++.
//
// See also:  CXFILEFMT.H in Maestro development folder.  This includes a complete version history for data files
// created by Maestro and its earlier incarnation, Cntrlx.
//
//
// REVISION HISTORY:
// 28mar2003-- Modified from the original CXFILEFMT.H dtd 27mar2003.  Keep in synch w/ future changes!
// 19nov2003-- Updated to synch with changes to CXFILEFMT.H dtd 19nov2003 (a field added to header record).
// 26jan2005-- Updated to synch with changes to CXFILEFMT.H dtd 25jan2005.  No impact (just added some comments).
// 07apr2005-- Updated to synch with changes to CXFILEFMT.H dtd 06apr2005, related to the introduction of "tagged
//             sections" in trials.
// 29jul2005-- Updated to synch with version# change in CXFILEFMT.H dtd 29jul2005.  No format changes -- version
//             change marks changes in implementation of noise perturbations so that they can be reproduced by
//             readcxdata().
// 25jan2006-- Updated to synch with version# change in CXFILEFMT.H dtd 25jan2006.  Several new CXHF_ bit flags and
//             header information fields added to provide info relevant to the new "R/P Distro" feature.
// 18mar2006-- Updated to synch with version# change in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v1.5.0.  No format changes -- version
//             change marks change in TARGET_HOPEN trial code group to support velocity stabilization over a contiguous
//             span of trial segments instead of just one.
// 18apr2006-- Updated to synch with version# change in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v2.0.0 (data file version = 8).
//             Includes a significant change in the format of CX_TGTRECORD -- so we must check file version and use
//             the appropriate data structure when parsing target records in the file.  Also, new trial code
//             TARGET_VSTAB replaces TARGET_HOPEN; velocity stabilization can now occur on a per-target, per-segment
//             basis.
// 19jun2006-- Updated to synch with version# change in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v2.0.1 (data file version = 9).  Only 
//             change is the addition of fields 'fInnerX' and 'fInnerY' to XYPARM struct, defining offset of inner 
//             "hole" WRT to center of an XY scope RECTANNU target.  Size of enclosing union U_TGPARMS is *unchanged*.
// 16may2007-- Updated to synch with version# change in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v2.1.1 (data file version = 10). Added 
//             CXFILEHDR.iRPDRespType, which indicates the type of behavioral response measured during an R/P Distro 
//             trial (4 different measures are now supported, as defined by TH_RPD_** constants in cxobj_ifc.h).
// 16jul2007-- Updated to synch with version# change in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v2.1.2 (data file version = 11). No 
//             format changes. Marks introduction of support for perturbing trial target window or pattern speed, and 
//             a minor implementation change for the XYScope NOISYSPEED target: speed noise offset granularity is now 
//             1% instead of 0.1%.
// 06sep2007-- Updated to synch with version# change in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v2.1.3 (data file version = 12). No 
//             format changes. Marks introduction of support for simultaneous window/pattern speed or direction perts
//             PERT_ON_SPD, _ON_DIR in cxobj_ifc.h), and for multiplicative speed noise in XYScope NOISYSPEED tgt 
//             and RMVideo RMV_RANDOMDOTS tgt. Also, additive speed noise granularity is now 1% instead of 0.1% for the 
//             RMV_RANDOMDOTS tgt to bring it in line with NOISYSPEED.
// 17sep2009-- Updated to synch with version# change in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v2.5.0 (data file version = 13). The
//             RMVTGTDEF structure was altered to include new fields char[32] strFolder and char[] strFile, for the new
//             RMV_MOVIE target. Additional RMVideo target flags also defined, including RMV_F_ORIENTADJ for the
//             RMV_GRATING target. When this flag is set, the target does NOT ignore the V cmpt of pattern velocity 
//             during animation. The grating orientation adjusts frame-by-frame so that it is always perpendicular to
//             the pattern velocity vector.
// 20jan2010-- Updated to synch with version# change in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v2.5.2 (data file version = 14). No 
// format changes. Introduced new flag RMV_F_WRTSCREEN, which affects behavior of the RMVideo RMV_RANDOMDOTS target 
// only. If set, target pattern motion is specified in global (screen) frame of reference rather than WRT the target
// window. This change permitted a better emulation of the XYScope NOISYDIR and NOISYSPEED targets in the case where 
// target window and dots were moving in the same direction at the same speed (ie, the dots are not moving WRT the 
// target window). In addition, relaxed restrictions to permit velocity stabilization of all RMVideo and XYScope tgts.
// 29apr2010-- Updated to synch with changes in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v2.6.0 (data file version = 15). Added fields
// CXFILEHDR.iStartPosH, .iStartPosV. Also, increased max # dots for RMVideo RMV_RANDOMDOTS and RMV_FLOWFIELD targets
// from 1000 to 9999 (in rmvideo_common.h).
// 24may2010-- Update to synch with changes in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v2.6.1 (data file version = 16). Added header
// field CXFILEHDR.dwTrialFlags.
// 09mar2011-- Update to synch with changes in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v2.6.5 (data file version = 17). Added header
// field CXFILEHDR.iSTSelected and several header flags related to the new Trial-mode "searchTask" feature.
// 17may2011-- Update to synch with changes in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v2.7.0 (data file version = 18). Added header
// field CXFILEHDR.iVStabWinLen that indicates length of sliding window average of eye pos for VStab.
// 11may2012-- Update to synch with changes in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v3.0.0 (data file version = 19). No format 
// changes; this merely marks the release of Maestro 3, which runs on Windows 7/RTX 2011.
// 06sep2013-- Update to synch with changes in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v3.0.3 (data file version = 19, unchanged).
// Changed constant CX_SPIKESORTREC_LAST from 20 to 57, plus some relevant comments
// 24nov2015-- Update to synch with changes in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v3.2.0 (data file version = 20). This Maestro
// version introduces support for the Eyelink eye tracker, and the data file includes some Eyelink-specific info: a
// new header flag CXHF_EYELINKUSED, a header field iELInfo[], plus "blink start" and "blink end" events that are 
// stored in the same record type as digital pulses on DI<2..15>. The event masks for these blink events do not overlap
// with the digital input events, and event times are in ms rather than 10us ticks.
// 12jun2018â€”- Update to sync with changes in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v4.0.0 (data file version = 21). In addition to
// marking the release of 4.0, which migrates Maestro to 64-bit Win10/RTX64, two fields were added to the file header,
// CXFILEHDR.setName and CXFILEHDR.subsetName.
// 01oct2018-- Update to sync with additional changes in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v4.0.0, dtd 01oct2018. Two more fields
// were added: rmvSyncSz and rmvSyncDur.
// 04dec2018-- Update to sync with additional changes in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v4.0.1, dtd 04dec2018. Added the
// timestampMS field.
// 27mar2019-- Update to sync with changes in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v4.0.5 (date file version = 22) Added the 
// rmvDupEvents[CXH_RMVDUPEVTSZ] field, the CXHF_DUPFRAME flag, and noted the change in the multiplier for the 
// d_framerate field.
// 13may2019-- Update to sync with changes in CXFILEFMT.H for Maestro v4.1.0 (data file version = 23). The RMVTGTDEF
// structure was altered to include 3 new int fields related to target "flicker".
// 04jun2021 -- Modifying JMWork and read/editcxdata to support up to 200 (instead of 50) sorted spike train channels.
// This does NOT impact Maestro, as the sorted spike train records are added to the data file by the post-analysis
// software. Merely added comments in this file to document the change.

//
//    1) Compressed AI data (record tag 0).  The compressed, slow-sampled AI data are stored chronologically in one or
//    more records.  Since no compressed byte will have the value 0, we mark the end of the compressed data stream by
//    filling the empty portion of the last record with zeros.  Analysis programs must have knowledge of the
//    compression algorithm in order to decode these records.
//
//    2) Event records (record tags 1-3).  Maestro/Cntrlx records digital events (occurrence of rising edge) on any of
//    16 inputs DI<15..0> on the event timer device.  We store separate event records for events on DI<0> (usually
//    reserved for recording spikes), events on DI<1> (usually reserved for a second spike channel or a marker pulse),
//    and events on any of DI<15..2>.  In the first two cases, we save 32-bit interevent intervals (where one tick =
//    10microsec), thusly:
//          CXFILEREC.u.iData[0] = interval between event# 0 and 1,
//          CXFILEREC.u.iData[1] = interval between event# 1 and 2,
//          ....
//          CXFILEREC.u.iData[N] = interval between event# N and N+1, ....
//    where "event# 0" corresponds to the time at which recording began.  The unfilled portion of the last record is
//    filled with the integer 0x7FFFFFFF, which serves as an "endOfData" marker.  Events on DI<15..2> are all stored in
//    record tag 3.  Here we must save both the event mask and the absolute 32-bit event time (again, one tick = 10us),
//    as follows:
//          CXFILEREC.u.iData[0] = event mask for event#0 on any of DI<15..2> (multiple simultaneous events possible!)
//          CXFILEREC.u.iData[1] = time of occurrence of event#0
//          ....
//          CXFILEREC.u.iData[N] = event mask for event#(N/2) on any of DI<15..2>
//          CXFILEREC.u.iData[N+1] = time of occurrence of event #(N/2), ...
//    In this case, the "endOfData" marker is the sequence of two integers {0, 0x7FFFFFFF}, repeated until we reach the
//    end of the record.
//
//          [VERSION >=20 ] Record tag 3 is also used to store "blink start" and "blink end" events detected when using
//    the Eyelink tracker to measure the subject's eye trajectory. These two events have special event masks, 
//    CX_EL_BLINKSTARTMASK and CX_EL_BLINKENDMASK, that don't overlap with events on DI<15..2>. Event time is specified
//    in milliseconds rather than 10us ticks, since they're detected during runtime processing, not timestamped by the
//    event timer. They will occur in matching start-end pairs (although not necessarily adjacent, since there could be
//    DI events in between) -- except when the subject is mid-blink at the start or end of the data recording.
//
//    3) Trial codes (record tag 4).  We store the trial code array CODES[] that defines a trial in chronological order
//    in one or more records as needed.  So:
//          CXFILEREC.u.tc[0] = TC[0],
//          CXFILEREC.u.tc[1] = TC[1],
//          ....
//    If the last trial code record is only partially full, we set the remaining bytes to zero.  Note that the last
//    trial code is always ENDTRIAL, so there is no need to define a "endOfTrialCodes" byte!  New trial codes have been
//    introduced over the development history of Maestro and its UNIX-based predecessor Cntrlx.  See CXTRIALCODES.H and
//    review Cntrlx's revision history for details...  Of particular note is the TARGET_PERTURB trial code, since
//    support for perturbations was entirely overhauled in Maestro.
//
//    3a) Trial tagged sections (record tag 68). [VERSION >= 4].  A TrialMode data file will have one of these records
//    if any tagged sections are defined on the trial that was executed.  The record contains a set of TRIALSECT
//    structures, one for each distinct section in the trial.  All unused bytes in the record are set to zero, so the
//    first TRIALSECT structure with an empty tag name marks the end of the section list!
//
//    4) Target definitions (record tag 65). [VERSION >= 2]  In a TrialMode data file, these records will contain the
//    definitions of all targets participating in the trial.  Each target is "persisted" as a CXFILETGT data structure,
//    which is defined here.  The target definition itself is encapsulated by the CXTARGET structure, which is fully
//    described in the Maestro object interface file CXOBJ_IFC.H; additional info in the CXFILETGT struct applies only
//    to ContMode data files.  More than one target definition can appear in each target defn record, and the target
//    definitions are listed in the same order that they appear in the trial definition.  This ordering is SIGNIFICANT,
//    since each target participating in a trial is identified in the TRIALCODEs by the target's ordinal position in
//    the trial target list!!!
//       In a ContMode data file, this record type is used to report the definitions of any targets in the active
//    target list, followed by any targets participating in an XYseq.  Again, we use the CXFILETGT data structure to
//    describe each target, and the targets are stored in the record in the same order they appear in the active list
//    and XYseq target list.  Unlike for TrialMode targets, we also provide target position and some state information
//    for ContMode targets.  For XYseq targets, the target position gives the initial and final position of each tgt
//    during the stimulus run, since the XYseq stimulus does not permit target window motion (only pattern motion).
//
//       If the last target defn record is only partially full, we set the remaining bytes to zero.  The remaining
//    "dummy" target records will contain invalid data (in particular, 0 is an invalid target type).
//
//       [VERSION < 8] The CXTARGET structure, part of CXFILETGT, changed when RMVideo replaced the old VSG FB video 
//    in Maestro 2.0.0.  To accommodate the parsing of target records from data files with v <= 7, we include the old 
//    structure definitions:  CXTARGET_V7, CXFILETGT_V7. CXTARGET_V7 depends on U_TGPARMS_OLD and FBPARMS, which are 
//    defined in cxobj_ifc.h Analysis programs MUST check the data file version and use the correct structure to 
//    properly parse target records!!!
//
//       [VERSION >= 9] Two new fields were added to XYPARMS, which is one member of the union U_TGPARMS that appears 
//    in CXTARGET.  Since XYPARMS is still the smallest member of U_TGPARMS, the storage size of U_TGPARMS and CXTARGET 
//    are UNCHANGED.  However, external programs that need to fully parse the target records in a data file must be 
//    revised to handle the new fields, XYPARMS.fInnerX and XYPARMS.fInnerY.
//
//       [VERSION >= 11] Percentage speed noise granularity for the XYScope NOISYSPEED target was changed from 0.1% to 
//    1%. This was only an implementation change. The speed noise limit stored in XYPARMS.fInnerW was already stored 
//    as a whole %.
//
//       [VERSION >= 12] Percentage speed noise granularity for the RMVideo RMV_RANDOMDOTS target was changed from 
//    0.1% to 1%. RMVTGTDEF.iNoiseLimit (see rmvideo_common.h) now stores the speed noise limit as a whole % in 
//    [0..300], rather than in units of 0.1%. In addition, both the NOISYSPEED and RMV_RANDOMDOTS implementations were 
//    extended to introduce a second, multiplicative method of per-dot speed noise generation: Rdot ~ Rpat * 2^X, 
//    where X is uniformly chosen from [-N..N], where the "noise limit" N must be an integer in [1..7]. This noise 
//    limit is stored in XYPARMS.fInnerW or RMVTGTDEF.iNoiseLimit. To select the multiplicative speed noise algorithm, 
//    the field XYPARMS.fInnerX is nonzero, or RMVTGTDEF.iFlags includes the newly defined flag RMV_F_SPDLOG2.
//
//       [VERSION >= 13] Introduced RMVideo target type RMV_MOVIE. Required introduction of new fields to the RMVideo
//    target definition struct RMVTGTDEF (the char[] arrays RMVTGTDEF.strFolder and .strFile), triggering changes to 
//    U_TGPARMS, CXTARGET, and CXFILETGT. To accommodate parsing of target records from data files with v=[8..12], we 
//    include the old structure definitions CXTARGET_V12 and CXFILETGT_V12. These definitions depend on deprecated types 
//    RMVTGTDEF_V12 (located in rmvideo_common.h) and U_TGPARMS_V12 (in cxobj_ifc.h).
//
//       [VERSION >= 23] Introduced new "flicker" feature applicable to all RMVideo target types. Required introduction
//    of 3 new integer fields to the RMVideo target definition struct RMVTGTDEF, triggering changes to U_TGPARMS, 
//    CXTARGET, and CXFILETGT. To accommodate parsing of target records from data files with v=[13..22], we include
//    the old structure definitions CXTARGET_V22 and CXFILETGT_V22. These definitions depend on deprecated types 
//    RMVTGTDEF_V22 (located in rmvideo_common.h) and U_TGPARMS_V22 (in cxobj_ifc.h).
//
//    5) Stimulus run definition (record tag 66). [VERSION >= 2]  A ContMode "stimulus run" is defined by some general
//    header parameters, a series of STIMCHAN channels (not all of which may be turned on), and a set of XY scope tgts
//    participating in the run's XYseq stimulus channel (if there is one).  The XYseq target set is reported in the
//    target definition record(s), as described above.  The stimulus run header, along with the defns of those stimulus
//    channels which were turned ON, are persisted using this record type.  The header and each stimulus channel defn
//    are stored as one or more CXFILESTIM_U structures within the 1024-byte record.  The first CXFILESTIM_U object in
//    the record is always the header info, while the remaining objects in the first (and, if necessary, a second)
//    record are the stimulus channel definitions.
//
//       !!! CAVEAT:  Target and stimulus run information saved here merely represent Maestro's state AT THE TIME
//       !!! RECORDING BEGAN.  Active target position and state can be interactively changed by the user as recording
//       !!! progresses.  Also, we save the current stimulus run information even if it is not actually running
//       !!! because, in typical usage, Maestro will "preload" the stimulus run, then start recording, then start the
//       !!! previously loaded run!  We include a flag that indicates whether or not the currently efined run is
//       !!! actually in progress.
//
//    6) Compressed spike trace data (record tag 67). [VERSION >= 2] Maestro dedicates a single channel to record the
//    raw electrode signal from which "spikes" (or "units", aka action potentials) are extracted.  The channel is
//    sampled at 25KHz in order to adequately capture each action potential.  "Fast" channel data is recorded at the
//    same time as the "slow-sampled" AI channels (record 0) by a single AI device, and is compressed in the same way.
//
//    7) Analysis action records (tag 5). These are NOT created by Maestro; rather, they are appended to the data file
//    later by analysis programs like the now-obsolete XWork and its Java-based successor JMWork.
//
//    8) Sorted spike-train records (tag 8-57). These records are NOT created by Maestro, rather they are appended to
//    the data file later by analysis programs like XWork, JMWork, and the Matlab utility editcxdata(). These records
//    represent interevent intervals for "spikes" detected in high-resolution spike waveforms recorded by Maestro or
//    the Plexon system. Format is identical to that of spike event records (tag=1). Allows for up to 50 distinct spike
//    trains to be associated with the original recorded data file.
//         [VERSION >= 19, rev 05sep2013] Originally, XWork supported 13 distinct spike trains, with record tags 8-20.
//    JMWork and editcxdata() supported the same. JMWork and editcxdata() have been updated to support up to 50
//    different sorted-spike trains, with record tags 8..57. Prior to this change, record tags 21-57 were never used.
//         [04jun2021] Modifying JMWork and read/editcxdata() to support up to 200 sorted-spike train channels. To do
//    so, the programs make use of the second byte in the record tag to specify M=0..3, along with N=8..57 in byte 0.
//    The channel # is M*50 + (N-8), which ranges from 0-199.
