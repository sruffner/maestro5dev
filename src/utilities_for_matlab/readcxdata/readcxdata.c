// readcxdata.c --   Implementation of MATLAB MEX function readcxdata() which parses analog data, digital event data,
//                   and other information from a Maestro or Cntrlx (ie, cntrlxUNIX/PC) data file.
//
// AUTHOR:  saruffner.
//
// DESCRIPTION:
//
//
// CREDITS:  This MEX function is based on Justin Gardner's readTrialData(), with mods by David Schoppik.  I worked on
// its handling of ContMode data files, fixed some miscellaneous bugs, and modified it to handle data files with
// version >= 2.  Such files are generated by Maestro, a WinNT/2000/XP application that handles the functionality of the
// older cntrlxUNIX, cntrlxPC, and spikesPC all on a single PC platform.  The function can also read in files
// generated by cntrlxUNIX/PC, which I refer to as Cntrlx for short.
//
//
// REVISION HISTORY:
// 14mar2003-- Began development, using the source code from JG's READTRIAL.* and DECODE.* as a starting point.
// 29sep2003-- Modified processEdits() so that it skips over unrecognized action codes instead of aborting -- which is
//             what readTrialData() did.  XWORK appears to write some extraneous junk in the action edit record!
// 01oct2003-- Modified to support reading in "sorted spikes" channel records appended by XWORK.
// 19nov2003-- Modified to read in new field added to CXFILEHDR: 'dwXYSeed' is the value used to seed the random#
//             generators in the XY scope controllers (applicable to trial mode only).  In Cntrlx (V<=1), this seed
//             value was communicated via the trial code RANDOM_SEED.
// 20jan2004-- Fixed bug in uncompressAIData() that caused it to fail increment the scan count for the last scan's
//             worth of analog data decompressed.
// 10may2004-- Added fields 'patvelH' and 'patvelV' to the output field 'targets'.  These hold the computed velocity
//             trajectories for the patterns associated with certain extended video targets on the XY scope and
//             framebuffer platforms.  This is rather wasteful except when a target pattern is perburbed, and
//             readcxdata() does not yet interpret the TARGET_PERTURB trial code set!
// 14may2004-- Fixed bug in processing TARGET_H/VPOSREL trial codes in processTrialCodes().
//          -- Updated processTrialCodes() so that it "moves" XY scope targets that are turned off IF the data file
//             was created by Maestro v1.2.1 or greater.  Prior to that version, XY targets did NOT move while off.
// 19may2004-- Updated processTrialCodes() to account for the effects of velocity stabilization on the position
//             trajectory of the selected target.  The target's velocity trajectory is NOT adjusted and thus will not
//             accurately reflect the target's motion during the "open loop" segment.
// 21jun2004-- Updated processTrialCodes() to also adjust the window velocity (hvel, vvel) of the stabilized target
//             during velocity stabilization.  This was simply a matter of adding the eye velocity to the target's
//             precomputed velocity.
//          -- WARNING messages are now written to STDOUT only if the verbose flag is set.  Several users have
//             complained about the messages...
// 08jul2004-- Minor change to uncompressAIData() to handle fact that Cntrlx uses 0xFF as the "endOfData" marker for
//             AI data records in a Continuous mode data file.  Also discovered that Cntrlx does NOT give an accurate
//             count of the actual # of bytes in the compressed AI data stream stored in the data file.  readcxdata()
//             gets the correct count.  This is not an issue with Maestro-generated files.
// 02oct2004-- Added endian-conversion routines so that readcxdata() will run on big-endian (Mac) machines.  All
//             Cntrlx/Maestro data files were created on little-endian machines.  Endianness is determined at runtime
//             rather than using a defined constant at compile time.
// 15dec2004-- Fixed minor bug in processTrialCodes() that caused seg fault when data file contained no analog data.
// 14jan2005-- Fixed bug in mexFunction() that caused seg fault when data file contained spike waveform data -- it
//             was trying to store waveform data into the 'data' field instead of the 'spikewave' field!
// 26jan2005-- Updated processTrialCodes() to skip over new trial code group MIDTRIALREW introduced into Maestro with
//             code changes dtd 25jan2005.
// 12apr2005-- Mods to process new CX_TAGSECTRECORD detailing tagged sections within a Maestro trial.
//          -- I think that setting up the "stimulusrun" field is causing "cache consistency error" in MATLAB after
//             execution of readcxdata().  Disabled code that creates this field to see if problems go away...
// 01aug2005-- Adding support to account for the effects of any perturbations (TARGET_PERTURB trial codes) on trial
//             target trajectories, including support for new noise perturbation PERT_ISGAUSS.
// 03jan2006-- Modified processTrialCodes() to handle new trial code group RPDWINDOW, introduced in Maestro v1.4.0.
// 25jan2006-- Modified trial header record processing to report values in new header fields, introduced in Maestro
//             v1.4.2, that provide info for the R/P Distro feature (if the trial uses it).
// 18mar2006-- Modified IAW changes introduced in Maestro v1.5.0: elimination of OKNDRUM tgt platform; velocity
//             stabilization can act over a contiguous range of trial segs instead of just one.
// 07apr2006-- Fixing bug in calculation of target trajectory during velocity stabilization.
// 19apr2006-- Various mods to handle changes introduced in Maestro v2.0.0 (data file version >= 8):
//             1) Replacement of VSG-based FB video with RMVideo targets.  A new data structure, RMVTGTDEF in
//             RMVIDEO_COMMON.H, replaces FBPARMS in the union U_TGPARMS (see CXOBJ_IFC_MEX.H).  This change affects
//             the storage of individual target definitions as CXFILETGT in the data file's target record(s).  We have
//             to be able to handle both ld (CXFILETGT_V7) and current formats.
//             2) Velocity stabilization is now possible on a per-target, per-segment basis; TARGET_HOPEN replaced by
//             TARGET_VSTAB trial code.  We have to do a bit more work to compensate the precomputed trajectories of
//             trial targets for the effects of velocity stabilization. Fcn processTrialCodes() updated accordingly.
// 19jun2006-- Mod to expose two new XY scope tgt defn params, XYPARMS.fInnerX and .fInnerY.  These were introduced in 
//             Maestro v2.0.1 (data file version 9).
// 27feb2007-- Mod processTrialCodes() to support four new trial codes, INSIDE_HACC, INSIDE_VACC, INSIDE_HSLOACC, and 
//             INSIDE_VSLOACC. These were introduced in Maestro v2.1.0 (data file version STILL = 9) to support 
//             per-segment pattern acceleration in H and V.
// 16may2007-- Mod to synch w/ changes introduced in Maestro v2.1.1 (data file version = 10), which supports 4 
//             alternative response measures for an R/P Distro trial. The response type is reported in the trial data 
//             file header.
// 16jul2007-- Mod to synch w/ changes introduced in Maestro v2.1.2 (data file version = 11), which adds support for 
//             perturbing trial target window or pattern speed while keeping direction constant. Changes isolated to 
//             the PERTMGR module.
// 06sep2007-- Mod to synch w/ changes introduced in Maestro v2.1.3 (data file version = 12), which adds support for 
//             simultaneously perturbing trial target window and pattern speed (PERT_ON_SPD), or window and pattern 
//             direction (PERT_ON_DIR). This version also introduced a second algorithm for per-dot speed noise for 
//             the NOISYSPEED XYScope tgt and the RMV_RANDOMDOTS RMVideo tgt, but those changes did not require any 
//             mod to READCXDATA.  (All changes isolated to PERTMGR module.)
// 09jan2008-- Mods to handle new action codes introduced in JMWork v1.0. A successor to XWork and its Matlab sister 
//             program MWork, JMWork lets the user manually add or remove individual spikes in a sorted-spike train 
//             channel. The original sorted spike train is stored in the appropriate records, while the individual 
//             edits are stored as ACTION_ADDSORTSPK and ACTION_REMOVESORTSPK actions. READCXDATA does not return the 
//             original unedited spike trains; the sorted spike trains in the output structure reflect any spike edits 
//             defined in the data file.
// 10jan2008-- Mod to ACTION_CUTIT processing. In addition to preparing the 'cut' field in the output structure, 
//             READCXDATA now actually makes the defined cuts in the eye-velocity data channels HEVEL, VEVEL, HDVEL.
//             The cuts are made after processing trial codes -- so that the code which does velocity stabilization of 
//             target trajectories works with the original uncut eye velocity data.
// 22jul2008-- Added output field 'psgm'. This structure contains the parametric definition of a Pulse Stimulus
//             Generator Module (PSGM) sequence delivered during a Maestro trial. If the data file was not recorded 
//             during Trial mode, or if the PSGM_TC trial code was not sent, this field will be an empty array. It 
//             does NOT provide a definitive indication of whether or not the PSGM sequence actually occurred.
// 20jan2009-- The 'marked' flag is now set if either of two "styles" of discard marks are encountered among the action
//             edits: the presence of at least one mark segment (XWork-style), OR a mark1 at t=-1 (MWork-style).
// 20jan2009-- Added output info 'trialInfo' holding some additional information about a Maestro trial, including info
//             on any perturbations applied during the trial.
// 17sep2009-- Mod to synch w/ changes introduced in Maestro v2.5.0 (data file version = 13), which adds support for a
//             video target class, RMV_MOVIE, on the RMVideo platform. This introduced changes in the RMVTGTDEF struct,
//             impacting the format of target definition records in the Maestro data file. Also added a flag that
//             changes the behavior of RMV_GRATING; if RMV_F_ORIENTADJ set, both H and V cmpts of pattern velocity are
//             significant during animation, specifying a standard pattern velocity vector. The grating orientation is
//             adjusted frame-by-frame so that it is always perpendicular to this vector. When the flag is not set, the
//             grating target behaves as before: grating orientation is a constant, the V cmpt of pattern velocity is 
//             ignored and the H cmpt is the grating's drift speed.
// 22feb2010-- Fixed problem with the algorithm for converting interevent intervals in 10us ticks to absolute event 
//             arrival times in ms (in readEvents() and readSortedSpikes()). Repeated reading by readcxdata() followed
//             by saving with editcxdata() introduced jitter in the arrival times that worsened with repetition, due to
//             double=>int roundoff issues.
// 29apr2010-- Mod to synch w/ changes introduced in Maestro v2.6.0 (data file version = 15). Two fields were added to
//             the data file header, CXFILEHDR.iStartPosH, .iStartPosV. These are exposed as like-named members of the 
//             "key" field in the output structure generated by the MEX function.
// 21may2010-- Added field "on" to "targets" structure in output. This field is a 1xM cell array, where M is the number
//             of targets in trial. Each cell contains a vector with ON epochs, intervals during which that target was
//             ON during the trial: [tOn1 tOff1 tOn2 tOff2 ... ]. Times in ms in the RECORDED timeline. Since it 
//             includes ON epochs that may have occurred prior to start of recording, some times could be negative.
//             They will be in chronological order. See processTrialCodes().
// 24may2010-- Mod to synch w/ change introduced in Maestro v2.6.0 (data file version = 16). Field added to the data
//             file header, CXFILEHDR.dwTrialFlags. It is exposed in a like-named member of the "key" field in the
//             output structure generated by this MEX function.
// 22sep2010-- Mods to handle new action codes introduced in JMWork v1.4.0. (1) The ACTION_DISCARD action (#codes=1) is
// added to the file to indicate that it should discarded/ignored in downstream analysis. This is intended to replace
// the "hacked" conventions for marking a file as discarded. The ACTION_DEFTAG action (#codes=6) attaches a labelled
// "tag" to the recorded timeline. The tag label is user-defined and must contain 1-16 visible ASCII characters. A tag
// is a truly general-purpose mark that the user can tailor to his/her needs. The tag's timestamp is the second code in
// the code group. The remaining 4 32-bit int codes form a 16-byte label field, packed in little-endian order and 
// padded with zeros if the label length is less than 16.
// 09mar2011-- Fixed bug in processTrialCodes() regarding computation of trial trajectories for RMVideo targets. Prior
// to fix, code was erroneously using the XYScope frame update interval (typ. 4ms) for the video frame update interval
// instead of the RMVideo display update interval.
//          -- Mod to synch w/ changes introduced in Maestro v2.6.5 (data file version = 17). Field added to the data
// file header, CXFILEHDR.iSTSelected. It is exposed in a like-named member of the "key" field in the output structure 
// generated by this MEX function.
// 12apr2011-- Mods to support emulation of XYScope noisy-dots targets in Trial mode, for data file versions >= 12.
// Added module XYNOISYEM.* to implement the emulation. Two new fields in output: "xynoisytimes" and "xynoisy". These 
// will be empty if data file version < 12, if file was not recorded in Trial mode, or if no XYScope noisy-dots targets
// participated in the trial.
// 16may2011-- Added support for new implementation of XYScope noisy-dots targets introduced in Maestro v2.7.0, data 
// file version 18.  Added support for new "sliding-window average" feature during velocity stabilization of targets
// in Trial mode. See processTrialCodes().
// 20may2011-- Changed all instances of mxCreateScalarDouble to mxCreateDoubleScalar. mxCreateScalarDouble was declared
// obsolete in 2006, and code support is removed as of Matlab 2011a.
// 11may2012-- Began changes to replace the XYNOISYEM.* module with NOISYEM.*, which adds support for emulating RMVideo
// noisy-dots targets in Trial mode; XYNOISYEM.* only supported noisy-dots targets on the XYScope display platform. The 
// per-dot trajectories are still stored in the same fields in the output structure, "xynoisytimes" and "xynoisy", so as
// not to break existing analysis code that looked at XYScope noisy-dots targets. 
// 16may2012-- Finished testing/debugging changes dtd 11may2012. Decided to include per-dot position as well as velocity
// trajectories in "xynoisy" -- but ONLY for RMVideo noisy-dots targets; it's not possible to keep track of per-dot
// positions for XYScope.
// 06sep2013-- Revised to support 50 distinct sorted-spike train data channels instead of 13. This was mostly a matter
// of documenting the change and and updating a few constants. See cx_filefmt_mex.h for more details.
// 12aug2014-- Bug fix in processTrialCodes(). 
// 24nov2015-- Revised to handle Maestro data file changes relevant to added support for Eyelink tracker, as of Maestro
// version 3.2.0, data file V=20. Revised out.key to include new header fields iVStabWinLen (V=18) and iELInfo (V=20).
// Added out.blinks, an array of length N*2 listing N "blink epochs" recorded on the Eyelink 1000+ tracker. Each pair 
// of entries in the array represent the start and end times of a blink, in ms elapsed since recording started.
// 16nov2016—- MINOR revision to recognize the new RMVideo target type RMV_IMAGE, introduced in Maestro v3.3.1. Note 
// that data file version did NOT change. We just need to test for type RMV_IMAGE so that the ‘strFolder’ and ‘strFile’
// fields are set correctly in setTargetDefns().
// 12jun2018— Revised to handle Maestro data file format changes in Maestro V4.0.0, which migrates Maestro to the 
// 64-bit Win10/RTX64 platform. Data file V=21. Revised out.key to include new header fields setName[] and subsetName[]
// which hold the name of a trial’s parent set and subset, as applicable.
// 01oct2018-- Revised to handle another data file format change for Maestro 4.0.0. Revised out.key to include new
// header fields rmvSyncSz and rmvSyncDur to hold spot size and flash duration for new RMVideo "vertical sync flash".
// 04dec2018-- Revised to handle data file format change in Maestro 4.0.1 (data file version unchanged). Revised out.key
// to include new header field timestampMS.
// 27mar2019-- Revisions to handle data file format change for Maestro 4.0.5 (data file version 22). Revised out.key to
// to include new header field rmvDupEvents[]. Also changed out.key.d_framerate to a double scalar storing the RMVideo
// refresh rate in milli-Hz. As of file version 22, CXFILEHDR.d_framerate is a 32-bit integer storing the refresh rate
// in micro-Hz instead of milli-Hz. To avoid impacting programs that might use out.key.d_framerate, I decided to keep
// the units the same, but storing it as a floating-point keeps the extra precision available in V>=22 data files. And
// since d_framerate is used within READCXDATA to calculate the RMVideo refresh period, that calculation now depends on
// the file version!
// 13may2019-- Revised to handle data file format change for Maestro 4.1.0 (data file version 23). Target definition
// record format was altered by the addition of three int-valued parameters to the RMVTGTDEF structure defined in 
// rmvideo_common.h to support a new "flicker" feature for RMVideo targets.
// 22may2021-- Added per-segment fixation target designations in output fields trialInfo.fix1 and trialInfo.fix2. Each
// is a 1xN integer array where N = # of segments. Each element is a zero-based index into trial target list that 
// identifies which target is designated as "Fix 1" or "Fix 2" for that segment; -1 = "NONE". See processTrialCodes()
// and setTrialInfo().
// 04jun2021-- Mods to support 200 distinct sorted-spike train channels instead of 50. To do so, we make use of the
// second byte in the 8-byte record tag to store a multiplier M in [0..3]. Combined with the sorted spike train tag
// N=8..57, we have 4 "banks" of 50 different channels. Channel # = M*50 + (N-8).
// 20nov2024-- Removed vestigial field 'stimulusrun' from output. READCXDATA was never updated to populate the 
// 'stimulusrun' field, and stimulus runs were a rarely-if-ever used feature in Maestro. As of Maestro V5.0.2 (data
// file version 25), Maestro no longer even write stimulus run records into the dat file. Regardless the data file
// version, READCXDATA now simply skips over any data file record with id tag CX_STIMRUNRECORD. 
//          -- Removed vestigial field 'psgm' from output. The PSGM was designed conceptually and a prototype tested,
// but a working module was never put to use in any experiment rigs. The PSGM was removed from Maestro altogether in
// V5.0.2 (data file version = 25).
// 09dec2024-- MAX_TRIALTARGS increased to 50.
// 18dec2024-- Revised to handle data file format change for Maestro 5.0.2 (data file version 25). Target definition
// record format was altered by the addition of the float-valued parameter 'fDotDisp' to the RMVTGTDEF structure
// defined in rmvideo_common.h.

//    This is the method called from MATLAB to read in CNTRLX data files.

//          'filename'  ==> pathname of the CNTRLX data file.
//          verbose     ==> if nonzero, detailed progress msgs are written to STDOUT (for debugging).
//          nchans      ==> for headerless ContMode data files, we need to know how many analog data channels were
//                          recorded in order to properly parse the compressed analog data in the file.

//=== uncompressAIData ================================================================================================
//
//    Uncompress a CNTRLX analog input byte stream sampling the specified number N of AI channels.  When more than one
//    channel is recorded, the data are stored in the output buffer as [ch1(0), ..., chN(0), ch1(1), ..., ch1(N), ...].
//    Uncompressed data is in the range of a 12bit analog-to-digital converter: [-2048..2047].
//
//    Compression algorithm:  Each compressed sample represents the DIFFERENCE from the previous sample.  If this
//    difference is in [-63..63], it is encoded as a single byte in [0x01..0x7F].  Observe that bit 7 is NOT set.  To
//    get back the sample, subtract 64 from the encoded byte, then add the result to the value of the last sample on
//    the current channel.  If the difference is in [-2048..-64, 64..2047], it is encoded as two bytes in the range
//    [0x8800..0x8FC0, 0x9040..0x97FF], with the high byte first.  In this case bit 7 is set in the high byte -- that's
//    how we distinguish between a one-byte and two-byte compressed datum.  To uncompress the two-byte datum, we pack
//    the two bytes into a 16bit int, clear bit 15, and subtract 4096 to recover the difference, which is then added
//    to the value of the last sample to get the current sample value.  OBSERVE that, if a given sample is compressed
//    as one byte, it will never have the value 0x00; for a 2-byte compressed sample, the high byte is never 0x00.  In
//    fact, CNTRLX uses the zero byte to mark the end of the compressed data stream.  We stop as soon as we reach this
//    end-of-stream marker -- thus we will know exactly how many bytes were compressed and how many scans of real data
//    were saved.
//
//    20jan2004: BUG FIX.  When the # of compressed bytes is an integer multiple of CX_RECORDBYTES, there is no "end of
//    data" marker (the zero byte) in the compressed data buffer.  Prior to this fix, this method would abort
//    before incrementing the scan counter for the last scan's worth of data.  As a result, readcxdata() warned that
//    there was a mismatch between the #scans reported in the header and the actual number of scans read from file.
//
//    08jul2004: Cntrlx uses the byte value 0xFF rather than 0 as the "endOfData" mark in Continuous mode files, while
//    it uses 0 for Trial mode files.  Maestro uses 0 as the "endOfData" mark always.  To decompress Cntrlx-generated
//    Continuous mode files properly, we check for the presence of either of these markers.  The compression algorithm
//    guarantees that 0xFF will never appear as the value of a 1-byte compressed sample, nor as the first byte of a
//    2-byte compressed sample.

//=== readSortedSpikes ================================================================================================
//
//    Read events from a "sorted spike train channel" record into the appropriate internal buffer. Reallocate each
//    buffer as needed; abort if reallocation fails.
//
//    When recording from neural units, researchers often do "spike sorting" after the fact. In the past, spike-sorting
//    was performed on either Maestro's high-res 25KHz electrode recording, or the 50KHz recording by the older Cntrlx
//    partner app "spikesPC". Nowadays, multiple units are recorded using the Plexon or Omniplex system.
//
//    Regardless the source, some users elect to keep the sorted spike train times with the behavioral response data.
//    To this end, READCXDATA/EDITCXDATA and the Java-based JMWork program support appending "sorted spike train"
//    records to a previously recorded Maestro data file.
//
//    When the feature was first introduced, 13 distinct sorted spike train channels were supported, with record tags
//    (byte 0 of the 1KB record) 8-20. As of 06sep2013, 50 channels are supported, with tags 8-57. With the advent of
//    electrode arrays and simultaneous recording of many neural units, there has been demand for even more channels.
//    As of Jun 2021, we increased the number of distinct channels to 200 by using byte 1 of the record to specify a
//    "bank number" M in 0..3. Combined with tag N=8..57, the sorted spike train channel is computed as M*50 + N-8.
//
//        idTag[0]: N = CX_SPIKESORTREC_FIRST (8) ... CX_SPIKESORTREC_LAST (57)
//        idTag[1]: M = 0 .. 3
//        total # channels = NUMSPIKESORTCH = 4 * (CX_SPIKESORTREC_LAST - CX_SPIKESORTREC_FIRST + 1)
//
// 
//    In all sorted spike-train records, the "recorded" data are the interevent intervals between successive events
//    (ie, spike arrivals as determined by the sorting algorithm applied). The first interval is the absolute time of
//    occurrence of the spike (where T=0 is when recording started). All interval times are in 10us units. Here we
//    convert all event intervals back to absolute occurrence times, and convert all times to milliseconds.
//
//    Each sorted spike train channel record may contain up to CX_RECORDINTS interval times in CXFILEREC.u.iData[].
//    The last channel record may not be full; in such a case, the remaining "garbage" interevent intervals are set to
//    the "end of data" marker EOD_EVENTRECORD, defined in CXFILEFMT.H.  All such garbage data are ignored.
//
//    Each sorted spike train channel's sequence of spike arrival times are stored in a separate internal buffer.  The
//    internal buffers are lazily allocated and reallocated as needed, since most Maestro data files will not contain
//    this kind of information.

//=== processEdits ====================================================================================================
//
//    Process all XWORK editing actions stored in the relevant internal buffer.  The following actions are parsed into
//    fields of the MATLAB output structure returned by readcxdata():
//
//       ACTION_CUTIT ==> This action code describes a "saccade cut" made on the original data trace(s) in XWORK.  The
//          saccade cuts are stored in the MATLAB output as an Nx3 matrix, where N is the total # of saccade cuts.  For
//          each cut we must save the beginning & end points of the cut, and the AI channel# of the affected trace.
//       ACTION_MARK ==> This action code describes a "mark segment" placed by the user in XWORK.  The mark segments
//          are stored in the MATLAB output as an Nx2 matrix, where N is the total # of mark segments.  For each mark
//          segment we must save its beginning and end points.
//       ACTION_SETMARK1, ACTION_SETMARK2 ==> These action codes describe two different "mark points" that can be
//          placed by the user in XWORK.  Each mark point set (one for _SETMARK1, another for _SETMARK2) is stored in
//          the MATLAB output as an Nx1 matrix, where N is the total # of mark points.
//       ACTION_REMOVESORTSPK, ACTION_ADDSORTSPK ==> [Introduced in JMWork 1.0, circa 09jan2008] These action codes 
//          manually remove or add individual spikes to any of the "unedited" sorted-spike train data channels. The
//          unedited spike trains are stored in a separate sequence of 1KB records. Bytes 0 and 1 in the 8-byte record
//          tag hold integers N=CX_SPIKESORTREC_FIRST..CX_SPIKESORTREC_LAST, and M=0..3, so that the spike train 
//          channel # = M*50 + N-CX_SPIKESORTREC_FIRST. 200 distinct channels are supported.
//             These actions are processed by actually modifying the sequences of spike arrival times that should have 
//          already been stored in CXFILEDATA.pdSortedSpikes[]. THUS, IT IS ESSENTIAL that this method be called AFTER
//          the entire file has been parsed and BEFORE the method setSortedSpikesOutput() is called to copy the 
//          (possibly edited) spike trains into the output structure. See also: addSortedSpike(), removeSortedSpike().
//       ACTION_DEFTAG ==> [Introduced in JMWork 1.4.0, Sep2010]. Action code group defines a "tag", ie, a user-defined 
//          label attached to the recorded timeline. Code following action ID is the timestamp in milliseconds. This
//          is followed by 4 32-bit ints containing 16-byte label field, packed in little-endian order and padded with
//          zeros if the label length is less than 16.
//       ACTION_DISCARD ==> [Introduced in JMWork 1.4.0, Sep2010]. Presence of this action code indicates that file has
//          been marked as "discarded", to be ignored by downstream analysis. It is an explicit discard mark intended
//          to replace the "hacked" conventions that were historically used in XWork and MWork.
//
//    Before processing the editing info in the internal buffer, we must allocate temporary arrays to hold the info
//    described above.  The function will fail if any of these allocations fail.  We release the memory -- including
//    the internal buffer that held the edit codes in the first place -- once we've copied the info into the MATLAB
//    output structure.
//
//    ARGS:       pOut  -- [in/out] ptr to the MATLAB structure array prepared by readcxdata().
//
//    RETURNS:    TRUE if successful; FALSE otherwise.

//=== removeSortedSpike, addSortedSpike =============================================================================== 
// 
//    Helper methods that handle action codes ACTION_REMOVESORTSPK and ACTION_ADDSORTSPK for processEdits(). They 
//    modify the corresponding sorted-spike train buffer in CXFILEDATA.pdSortedSpikes[ch], either removing a spike or 
//    adding one -- while keeping the spikes in chronological order.
//
//    NOTES:
//    1) This is an inefficient approach, since each invocation involves searching the spike train array and copying a 
//    portion of it shifted one element forward or backward. Spike edits are relatively rare, so we'll leave it this
//    way for now.
//    2) IMPORTANT: While processing sorted-spike train records, interspike intervals are converted from an integer 
//    number of 10us ticks to a double-valued elapsed time in milliseconds. Each spike edit time is saved in the action 
//    record as an integer-valued elapsed time in 10us ticks and here it is converted to a double-value in milliseconds 
//    for comparison with the sorted spike times that are in CXFILEDATA.pdSortedSpikes[]. These operations can

//
//    Modify any eye velocity data channels (HEVEL, VEVEL, HDVEL) currently stored in the 'data' field of the output 
//    structure IAW the per-channel saccade cuts that were processed from the data file's action records and stored in 
//    the 'cut' field.
//
//    For each saccade cut found, the method replaces the saccade in the trace with a straight line connecting the 
//    cut's endpoints -- exactly as the trace is displayed in the programs that do per-channel saccade cutting, XWork 
//    and its Java-based successor, JMWork. Any saccade cut defined on a channel other than HEVEL, VEVEL or HDVEL is 
//    ignored, since it makes no sense to cut saccades on any other data channels collected in Maestro.
//    
//    This method must be called AFTER the 'data' and 'cut' fields have been prepared. It is also important that it 
//    be called AFTER processTrialCodes(), since that method may access the eye trajectory data to compute target 
//    trajectories during velocity stabilization. It is important that ORIGINAL raw trajectory data be used for that 
//    task!

//=== processTrialCodes ===============================================================================================
//
//    Process all trial codes stored in the relevant internal buffer and calculate the expected trajectories of all
//    targets that participated in the trial.  These trial target trajectories and the old-style "target IDs" of the
//    participating trial targets are then stored in the "targets" field within the output structure generated by
//    readcxdata().
//
//    The old-style "target IDs" were used by cntrlxUNIX/PC and included dedicated IDs for "hard" targets such as
//    FIBER1, FIBER2, etc.  MAESTRO (data file version >= 2) does not use these IDs -- the target number stored in the
//    trial codes refers to the target's position in the trial target list.  To further identify the target, we must
//    look at the target definitions.  These definitions should already have been read into CXFILEDATA.  Regardless of
//    file version, we still prepare the list of old-style target IDs -- these have been part of the output from past
//    incarnations of readcxdata(), and downstream code may use them!
//
//    The function also saves, in our global internal buffer 'cxData', the number of segments in the trial, the start
//    time of each segment, and the trial time at which recording began.  This information is useful in preparing the
//    'tagSections' output field -- see setTagSections().
//
//    With Maestro file version >=5, the algorithm for generating noise perturbations is reproducible.  This function
//    now accounts for the effects of perturbation waveforms (TARGET_PERTURB code group) so long as the data file
//    version is >= 5.  See the PERTMGR module.
//
//    With Maestro file version >=7 (as of app v1.5.0), velocity stabilization can occur over a contiguous span of
//    segments instead of just one.  The method takes this into account when computing the trajectory of a
//    velocity-stabilized target.
//
//    With Maestro file version >=8 (as of app v2.0.0), velocity stabilization can now be turned on/off on a
//    per-target and per-segment basis.  This method was updated accordingly.
//
//    As of Maestro v2.1.0 (file version = 9, introduced in app v2.0.1), additional trial codes INSIDE_***ACC 
//    support per-segment specification of pattern acceleration. Note that the INSIDE_VACC code is identical to a 
//    very old code, VSYNC_PULSE. As long as file version is 9+, the code is safely interpreted as INSIDE_VACC.
//
//    As of 7/22/08, output field 'psgm' is initialized IAW PSGM sequence parameters gleaned from trial code group
//    PSGM_TC. Retroactive to data file version 10, app v2.1.1 -- even though the PSGM hardware was only recently
//    installed in a lab rig.
//       [20nov2024] The PSGM module was never used successfully and has been abandoned. Maestro 5.0.2 dropped 
//       support for the PSGM entirely and no longer uses the PSGM_TC trial code group. Since the PSGM was never
//       really used, the 'psgm' field has been eliminated.
//
//    13apr2011-May2011: BUG FIXES AND OTHER CHANGES
//    1) In April 2011 we uncovered problems with the implementation of the XYScope NOISYDIR and NOISYSPEED targets. We
//    decided it would be useful to be able to replicate the erroneous implementation in READCXDATA in order to 
//    properly evaluate recorded neural and behavioral responses to these target stimuli. The functions that do this
//    are in the new XYNOISYEM.* module.
//
//    2) In prior versions, this method used the recorded HEVEL and VEVEL to adjust the horizontal and vertical 
//    velocity of a non-video target when that target was velocity-stabilized. I think this was an attempt to account 
//    for the effects of velocity stabilization in the target velocity traces generated by READCXDATA, while trying to 
//    keep them as smooth as possible. In any case, the adjusted velocity vector was fed to the perturbation manager -- 
//    which meant that any applied velocity perturbations would be messed up. In MaestroDRIVER, all perturbations are 
//    processed while generating the precomputed target trajectories. Furthermore, MaestroDRIVER only uses HGPOS and
//    VEPOS for VStab. ProcessTrialCodes() has been modified to do the same.
//
//    3) Prior to Maestro v2.7.0 (data file version 18), XYScope target pattern motion was specified WRT the screen, 
//    not the target window. The same is true for the RMVideo target RMV_RANDOMDOTS when the RMV_F_WRTSCREEN flag is
//    set. As a consequence, MaestroDRIVER must adjust BOTH the target window displacement and the target pattern
//    displacement each frame to account for velocity stabilization of that target. This adjustment messed up the
//    intended behavior of the NOISYDIR and NOISYSPEED targets. In order to emulate the trajectories of the individual
//    dots in these two target types, processTrialCodes() now makes the same adjustments. This means that the 
//    targets.patVelH/V fields will show the effects of velocity stabilization for XYScope targets and the
//    aforementioned RMVideo target. This change only applies to data files with version < 18 generated after 20sep2005
//    (Maestro v1.3.3); prior to this date, MaestroDRIVER did not make this particular adjustment.
//
//    4) Prior to Maestro v2.7.0, the target pattern of certain XYScope target types (FASTCENTER, COHERENTFC, FCDOTLIFE,
//    NOISYDIR, and NOISYSPEED) was offset by the change in target window position AT THE START OF A SEGMENT. If this  
//    was not done, their operation was compromised. The same applies to the RMVideo target RMV_RANDOMDOTS when the 
//    RMV_F_WRTSCREEN flag is set. ProcessTrialCodes() now accounts for this tweak, for data files with version 2-17 
//    (target definitions were added to the data file as of version 2).
//
//    5) As of Maestro v2.7.0 (data file version = 18), all XYScope target pattern motion is specified WRT the target
//    window, NOT the screen. VStab is now accomplished in MaestroDRIVER by adjusting target window position only. The 
//    tweaks described in (2) and (3) are no longer done (except for the RMVideo RMV_RANDOMDOTS target when the flag 
//    RMV_F_WRTSCREEN is set). In addition, this change means that the output fields target.patVelH/V will contain the 
//    target pattern velocity trajectory WRT the target window. As such these fields will not show the effects of 
//    velocity stabilization.
//
//    6) As of 11may2021: Per-segment fixation target designations are culled from the FIXEYE1/2 trial codes and stored
//    in the internal buffer: cxData.fix1[] and cxData.fix2[].
// 
//    7) Maestro v5.0.1 (data file version = 24, unchanged) introduced a new special op, "selDurByFix", in which target
//    selection during the special segment S determines the duration of segment S+1. The new SEGDURS trial code, sent 
//    only for segment S+1, specifies the min and max segment duration. At runtime, the min duration is used for 
//    seg S+1 if Fix1 is selected during the special seg, while the max duration is used if Fix2 is selected. The
//    trial codes are prepared under the assumption that the max duration is used for seg S+1. So, if Fix1 is actually
//    selected, we adjust the start times of segments S+2 onward, and the overall trial length, by subtracting
//    (max dur - min dur).
//
//    LIMITATIONS:
//    1) We make a concerted effort here to accurately calculate the "expected" trajectories of tgts participating in
//    the trial.  However, some trial operations -- such as "skipOnSaccade" -- preclude such calculations.  Warning
//    messages are printed to STDOUT in such cases.  Note that we compensate the position and velocity of a target
//    that is subject to velocity stabilization wrt the eye ("open loop").
//    2) We also do NOT bother to account for the effects of pixelization on the actual pos & vel of XY scope, VSG FB
//    video, or RMVideo targets.   We DO, however, attempt to account for the frame update intervals of the video
//    displays; these are both longer than a single time "epoch" (1ms) in TrialMode.  We assume that only one video
//    display is used during a trial -- not an unreasonable premise.
//    3) We do NOT try to account for the effects of interleaving XY scope tgts, another special feature in TrialMode.
