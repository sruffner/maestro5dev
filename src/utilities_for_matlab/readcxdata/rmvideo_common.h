//
// rmvideo_common.h : Constants and structure definitions shared by Remote Maestro Video and its Maestro counterpart.
//
// REVISION HISTORY:
// 22feb2006-- Target types RMV_SINEGRAT and RMV_SQUAREGRAT replaced by RMV_GRATING, with waveform type determined by
//             flag bit RMV_F_ISSQUARE.  Similarly, RMV_SINEPLAID and RMV_SQUAREPLAID replaced by RMV_PLAID.  Also
//             added field fSigma to RMVTGTDEF, although Gaussian window is not yet implemented.
// 07mar2006-- Increased precision with which floating-pt fields in RMVTGTVEC are encoded from 3 to 6.  We were
//             observing significant errors in net position change during a constant-velocity motion.  Floating-pt
//             params in RMVTGTDEF are still scaled by 1000.
// 29mar2006-- Added comments re: change in how RMVideo works during an animation sequence.  A "frame drop" signal
//             (either RMV_SIG_DUPFRAME or RMV_SIG_SKIPFRAME) is sent only once during the animation, instead of every
//             time a frame drop is detected.  This change is intended to support how Maestro uses RMVideo in Contiuous
//             mode -- sending RMV_CMD_UPDATEFRAME only sporadically (when the user manually toggles the target on/off
//             or changes its position).  Before this change, when Maestro started an RMVideo animation in Cont mode,
//             RMVideo quickly filled up its socket send buffer with lots of RMV_SIG_DUPFRAME signals!
// 30mar2006-- Added comment re: change in how RMVideo works during an animation sequence.  RMVideo will stop
//             animating and return to idle if a given display frame actually takes more than 50 monitor frame periods
//             to render.
// 04apr2006-- Added comments re: application of Gaussian window to RMV_SPOT and _RANDOMDOTS target types in addition
//             to RMV_GRATING and _PLAID.
//          -- Added support for elliptical and 1-D Gaussian windows: Field RMVTGTDEF.fSigma is now a 2-element array,
//             where the first element is the standard deviation in x, and the second is the std dev in y.  If both
//             are zero, Gaussian windowing is disabled.
// 06apr2006-- RMVTGTDEF.iRGBMean and .iRGBCon are now 2-element arrays -- to support separate color specs for the
//             two grating components of the RMV_PLAID target.
//          -- Added comments re: change in how RMVTGTVEC is used to update pattern motion of grating/plaid targets.
//             For gratings, RMVTGTVEC.hPat is the position change of the grating ALONG THE DRIFT AXIS, and vPat is
//             ignored.  For plaids, hPat is the position change of grating#1 along its drift axis, and vPat is the
//             position change of grating#2 along its drift axis.
//          -- Added flag RMV_F_INDEPGRATS.  This flag applies only to RMV_PLAID.  If set, the two gratings move
//             independently, with RMVTGTVEC.hPat and .vPat holding the position changes of grating #1 and #2, resp.,
//             along their respective drift axis directions.  This essentially replicates the old FB target types
//             TWOSINGRATS and TWOSQGRATS!  If the flag is not set, then (hPat,vPat) describes the net motion of the
//             plaid as a single pattern.
// 24apr2006-- Added command RMV_CMD_GETCOLORRES, by which RMVideo returns its color resolution: 16- or 24-bit.
// 04dec2006-- Constant RMV_MAXNOISESPEED incr'd to 3000, permitting speed noise up to 300% of nominal speed in the 
//             RMV_RANDOMDOTS target class.
// 31aug2007-- Mods to support a second algorithm for dot speed noise generation in the RMV_RANDOMDOTS target class. 
//             RMV_MAXNOISESPEED changed to 300. This is to bring RMVideo in line with a recent (v2.1.2) change in 
//             the XYScope NOISYSPEED target, in which the additive speed noise offset range granularity was changed 
//             to 1% instead of 0.1%.
// 13jul2009-- Added target type RMV_MOVIE. Experimental for now. The only applicable parameter in RMVTGTDEF is the 
//             target type. Eventually, other params will be added. The only parameter in RMVTGTVEC that applies is
//             the target on/off flag.
// 22jul2009-- Begun revisions to support reporting available video modes with a minimum horizontal resolution of 1024
//             pixels and a minimum refresh of 75Hz. Requires the XRandR extension. If that extension is not available
//             or not supported on the machine, RMVideo will still run but it won't be possible to change the display
//             resolution. Also, 24-bit color is now required. Added commands RMV_CMD_GETALLVIDEOMODES,
//             RMV_SETCURRVIDEOMODE. Deleted command RMV_CMD_GETCOLORRES. Also, the STARTANIMATE and UPDATEANIMATE
//             command descriptions have been revised to indicate that motion vectors are always supplied for all 
//             loaded targets on every frame (Maestro has been doing this anyway, and it simplifies code on the
//             RMVideo side).
// 23jul2009-- Begun revisions to support downloading movie files from Maestro to RMVideo, and uploading information 
//             about all stored movie files from RMVideo to Maestro -- all in support of the new "movie" target class.
// 18aug2009-- Added commands to support changing the monitor gamma from Maestro: RMV_CMD_GET/SETGAMMA.
// 24aug2009-- Added commands to support restart of RMVideo and reporting the program version.
// 25aug2009-- Deleted commands RMV_CMD_GETFRAMEPER and RMV_CMD_GETDISPRES. Instead, Maestro will retrieve all video
//             modes via RMV_CMD_GETALLVIDEOMODES, change the video mode with RMV_CMD_SETCURRVIDEOMODE, and retrieve
//             the current video mode (including measured frame period) with RMV_CMD_GETCURRVIDEOMODE.
// 11sep2009-- Added flag RMV_F_ORIENTADJ. It applies only to a single-grating target. 
// 04dec2009-- The RMV_F_ORIENTADJ flag now applies to plaid as well as grating targets. Version = 2.
// 20jan2010-- Added flag RMV_F_WRTSCREEN, which applies only to RMV_RANDOMDOTS target type. If set, pattern motion is
//             relative to the screen rather than the target window. It was introduced so that RMV_RANDOMDOTS can more
//             precisely emulate the behavior of XYScope NOISYDIR and NOISYSPEED targets when the target window is
//             moving. Version = 3.
// 24mar2010-- Relaxed restriction on max # of dots in RMV_RANDOMDOTS from 1000 to 9999. 
//          -- Corrected description of RMVTGTDEF.fOuterW, fInnerW for RMV_FLOWFIELD. Maestro sets these to radii, NOT
//             diameters! RMV_FLOWFIELD implementation likewise corrected.
//          -- Version = 4.
// 24nov2014-- Modified defn of RMV_RANDOMDOTS to include RMVTGTDEF.iRGBCon[0]. If contrast C != 0, then that color
//             component takes on two values, L1= M(1+C) and L2=M(1-C), where M=RMVTGTDEF.iRGBMean[0] and C=[0..1].
//             When any color component's contrast is non-zero, then the dot patch is a two-color contrast patch: half
//             the dots are drawn in one color, the rest in the other color. 
//          -- Version = 6.
// 23may2016-- As of Maestro v3.2.1, the auto-update feature has been removed. Maestro can no longer update an older
//             version of RMVideo over their private Ethernet link. The RMV_CMD_PUT*** commands are now only used to 
//             download movie files to RMVideo. Comments updated accordingly. Version unchanged.
// 04oct2016-- Began modifications to implement a new RMVideo target that displays a static image loaded from a JPEG,
//             PNG, PSD, BMP or GIF file that has been downloaded to RMVideo's "media store", which replaces the prior
//             notion of a "movie store". Some constants added. As with the RMV_MOVIE target, the definition for the new
//             RMV_IMAGE target includes a media folder name and file name. As of Maestro 3.3.1.
//          -- RMVideo version = 7.
// 24sep2018-- Mods to implement new feature: "vertical sync spot flash". A white square spot may be optionally 
// flashed in the TL corner of screen starting during any frame of an animation sequence. The size of the square, the
// width of a dark margin below and right of it, and the duration of the flash are sent to RMVideo only in the idle
// state via the new RMV_CMD_SETSYNC command. A new integer flag accompanying the STARTANIMATE and UPDATEFRAME commands
// indicates whether or not flash is presented.
//          -- As of Maestro v4.0.0 and RMVideo v8.
// 25sep2018-- Eliminated the "margin" parameter for the spot flash feature.
//
// March 2019:
// -- Changes in the Maestro-RMVideo communication protocol while in animate mode. Replaced the FIRSTFRAME, 
// SKIPFRAME, and DUPFRAME signals with a single all-purpose RMV_SIG_ANIMATEMSG message. It is sent under 4 distinct
// circumstances. See details below. Also removed the RMV_MAX_FRAMELAG constant; for all practical purposes, we require
// that RMVideo be able to render any video frame in less than one refresh period. 
// -- Modified response to GET/SETCURRVIDEOMODE to return the measured frame period as an integer in nanosecs instead
// of microsecs. Recent testing has shown that the truncation error when converting to microsecs is significant.
// -- As of Maestro v4.0.5 and RMVideo v9.
//
// 06may2019: As of Maestro v4.1.0 and RMVideo v10.
// -- Updating RMVideo to the OGL3.3-compatible implementation. This implementation was developed and evaluated over
// a five-month period from Dec 2018 - May 2019.
// -- Introducing new "flicker" feature applicable to all RMVideo target types. Modified RMVTGTDEF to include new 
// parameters governing flicker, and preserved the deprecated structure in RMVTGTDEF_V22 to parse data files that
// contain RMVTGTDEF_V22 records (data file versions 13-22).

// Begin a target animation sequence. Before a sequence begins, all targets defined by the preceding "load targets"
// command set are assumed to be turned OFF and positioned at the origin (center of screen). This command's payload
// includes the target motion update records for the first two frames of the animation sequence. RMVideo updates all 
// targets IAW the motion update records, renders the first frame on the back buffer, and swaps the front and back
// buffers during the next vertical blanking interval (VSync enabled). It then begins work on the second frame.
//
// As soon as the first display frame begins, RMVideo will send the RMV_SIG_ANIMATEMSG signal back to Maestro (with
// no payload) Maestro busy-waits for this signal, then starts acquiring data. The idea here is to *roughly* sync 
// Maestro's data acquisition timeline to the start of the first display frame.
//
// If an error occurs while rendering the first video frame, RMVideo returns RMV_SIG_CMDERR, followed by RMV_SIG_IDLE
// to indicate that it has returned to the idle state. One possible error is that it just takes too long to render
// the first frame.
//
// NOTE: In the description of DATA below, the vector counts N aren't really necessary, nor are the target IDs in each
// 6-tuple. These are artifacts of a previous, more flexible definition of the command, in which some vectors
// could be omitted if there is no change from the previous display frame. Maestro has always sent motion vectors for
// all targets on every frame, and we decided to get rid of this flexibility (without changing the command format) to
// simplify coding on the RMVideo side.
//
// DATA:  SYNC?, N, {V(0) ... V(N-1)}, N, {V(0) ... V(N-1)}. Per-frame target motion vectors are supplied for
// the first and second frames of the animation sequence. Integer N is the number of targets being animated, ie, which
// must be the same as the number of target definitions that are loaded. Each motion vector V(n) is a set of 6 integers. 
// The first integer in the 6-tuple is the target ID, which is simply that target's ordered position in the target list 
// (as defined in the preceding "load targets" command). The remaining 5 integers correspond to the members of the
// RMVTGTVEC structure, in the order in which the members appear in the structure definition. Most of these members are
// floating-pt; they are scaled by 1.0e^6 and rounded to the nearest integer for transmission to RMVideo. 
// 
// The first integer datum is a flag indicating whether or not the "vertical sync spot flash" should be presented,

#define RMV_CMD_UPDATEFRAME   80
// Update target motion for the next display frame.
//
// Once an animation begins, RMVideo leaves the "idle" state and enters a time-critical "animating" state.  By design,
// RMVideo "works ahead" by one frame during animation of video targets. At the start of animation, it prepares and
// displays the first frame, then begins work on the second frame. It expects Maestro to send target motion update
// information for display frame N so that it is ready to be processed at the start of frame N-1. THIS TIMING IS 
// CRUCIAL; if RMVideo does not receive the target update for frame N by the start of frame N-1, it will assume there 
// was no change for frame N -- so frame N will be a duplicate of frame N-1. In this scenario, RMVideo sends an 
// RMV_SIG_ANIMATEMSG message with the payload [N,0], where N = # elapsed video frames and 0 indicates that RMVideo
// detected a missed target update.
//
// RMVideo can only do so much during a single display frame. If the vertical retrace occurs before RMVideo is done
// rendering the next frame N in the backbuffer, then frame N will be a duplicate of frame N-1. If the rendering delay
// lasts several refresh periods, then there will be several duplicate frames in a row. Upon detecting this scenario,
// RMVideo issues RMV_SIG_ANIMATEMSG with the payload [N,X], where N is the elapsed frame count and X>=1 is the number
// of contiguous duplicate frames resulting from the rendering delay.
//
// Whenever a duplicate frame occurs, RMVideo will remain in the animate state. It is up to Maestro to decide whether
// or not to terminate the animation on a duplicate frame event.
//
// As an added check to ensure that Maestro is not getting ahead of the RMVideo animation, RMVideo will send an 
// RMV_SIG_ANIMATEMSG once per second. In this usage, the payload is [N], where N is the # of elapsed video frames in 
// the animation thus far. Maestro can check N against its own account of the # of elapsed frames to determine whether
// it is getting ahead of RMVideo's timeline (in which case UPDATEFRAME commands are building up in the network 
// receive buffer on the RMVideo side).
//
// RMVideo could also send the RMV_SIG_CMDERROR signal if it encounters a problem processing an UPDATEFRAME command.
// It will remain in animate mode, but Maestro must terminate the animation sequence if such an error occurs.
//
// DATA:  SYNC?, N, {V(0) ... V(N-1)} -- Target motion update vectors for the next display frame.  See description of the
// arguments to the "start animation" command. The first integer datum is a flag indicating whether or not the "vertical
// sync spot flash" should be triggered during this video frame. However, the spot flash will not be presented if the
// feature is disabled (zero spot size or zero flash duration), or if a previously triggered flash is already in progress
// (the flash duration can be up to 9 video frames).
// 
// REPLY:  NONE. However, messages may be sent back to Maestro during an animation sequence, as already described. 
// Maestro will check for any pending RMVideo message after sending each RMV_CMD_UPDATEFRAME command.

#define RMV_CMD_STOPANIMATE   90
// Stop animation immediately and return to idle state.  All previously defined targets are "unloaded".
// DATA:  None.

// RMVideo Media Store (formerly called the "Movie Store")
// RMVideo stores videos on the host system for playing back with the RMV_MOVIE target class, as well as images that may
// be displayed with the RMV_IMAGE target. It keeps all such media files in folders within the "media" folder in its
// installation directory. Thus, each media file is "identified" by its filename and the name of its parent folder. No
// media files may be stored directly in the "media" folder itself (well, you can put them there manually, but RMVideo
// will ignore them).
//
// At startup, RMVideo scans the immediate subdirectories of the "media" directory and prepares an internal "table of
// contents" so that it can respond quickly to queries about the media store's content. This scan can take an indefinite
// period of time, depending on the total number of folders and files in the media store.
//
// Media files can be downloaded from the Maestro client via commands described below. They can also be stored directly
// (eg, copied from CD/DVD media) in the RMVideo media directory, and RMVideo will detect the new files upon restarting.
//
// To keep things simple, media folder and file names are restricted in length and character content -- only ASCII
// alphanumeric characters, the period ('.'), and the underscore ('_'). In addition, there is a limit to the number of
// folders in the store and the number of files per folder (to put a bound on the replies to queries about media store
// content).
//
// Of course, all of the commands listed in this section may be sent ONLY when RMVideo is in the idle state.
