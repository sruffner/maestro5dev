// cxtrialseq.cpp : Implementation of class CCxTrialSequencer, MAESTRO's trial sequencer.
//
// AUTHOR:  saruffner
//
// DESCRIPTION:
// In TrialMode, MAESTRO "instructs" MAESTRODRIVER to present a sequence of trials drawn from a specified trial "set". 
// The order in which trials are selected for presentation depend upon the current "sequencer mode". Eight distinct
// sequencer modes are available: (1) repeated presentation of a currently selected trial; (2) presentation of each 
// trial in the trial set in order of appearance within the set; (3) same as (2), except that a failed trial is
// repeated until the subject successfully completes it; (4) a weighted, ordered presentation (using the trial 
// weights to set how many reps of a given trial are presented relative to the other trials in the set); (5) a weighted,
// randomized presentation of the trials; (6) a randomized presentation of trial "chains" (1-N consecutive reps of the 
// same trial, where N is the trial weight); (7) same as (6), except athat a failed trial is repeated until the subject
// successfully completes it; and (8) a specialized "staircase" presentation to support psychophysical protocols. Most 
// sequencer modes are available with or without fixation ("no fix") requirements enforced. While the trial selection 
// algorithm is straightforward for the first five modes, the staircase mode is complex and requires a significant 
// amount of additional overhead (both computation & data objects). CCxTrialSequencer encapsulates all of these trial 
// selection algorithms.
//
// As of MAESTRO v3.1.2, CCxTrialSequencer supports two levels of sequencing. Trial sets can now contain individual
// trials and/or trial subsets, which are simply collections of related trials. When a set contains at least one
// non-empty subset, the sequencer supports 3 possible subset sequencing types: (1) SUBSETSEQ_OFF -- disabled; all 
// trials in the set, including those in subsets, are treated as a single group; (2) SUBSETSEQ_ORDERED -- subsets are 
// presented in order of appearance in the parent set's child list; (3) SUBSETSEQ_RANDOM -- subsets are presented in
// random order (and the order is re-shuffled after all the subsets have been sequenced). When subset sequencing is
// enabled, the trials within a given subset are sequenced IAW one of the trial sequencing modes described above. NOTE,
// however, that the "current trial", "chained", and "staircase" trial sequencing modes are not allowed when subset
// sequencing is engaged. Furthermore, when a trial set contains individual trials as immediate children as well as
// trial subsets, each of those trials is treated as a separate subset containing just one trial.
//
// MAESTRODRIVER has no knowledge of MAESTRO data objects like CCxTrial and CCxTarget. Instead MAESTRO must convert 
// such data objects into a form that MAESTRODRIVER "understands". Target definitions must be converted to the 
// CXTARGET struct as defined in CXOBJ_IFC.H, while a trial is conveyed to MAESTRODRIVER as a sequence of trial codes, 
// detailed in CXTRIALCODES.H. [The trial codes scheme was adopted from Cntrlx, the original incarnation of MAESTRO, 
// in which the GUI ran on a UNIX machine and transmitted these trial codes (as well as other information and commands)
// over the network to a Windows PC that controlled the hardware and executed all experimental protocols.] 
// CCxTrialSequencer provides methods that handle these conversions.
//
// In short, CCxTrialSequencer is a "helper" class that relieves our TrialMode controller, CCxTrialMode, of the
// nitty-gritty details behind the sequencing of MAESTRO trials.
//
// ==> Usage.
//    Init() ==> Initialize the trial sequencer IAW specifed control parameters, as defined by the TRIALSEQCTRL struct.
//       Control parameters include the chosen trial set's object key, the "current" trial in that set, the subset and
//       trial sequencing modes, and some staircase sequence-specific parameters. Init() analyzes all the trials in the 
//       trial set, compiles the "target list" containing all targets used across the entire set, prepares for 
//       sequencing, and selects the first trial. This method must be called before any others. NOTE that it can fail 
//       for a myriad of reasons -- in which case it posts an error message using CCntrlxApp::LogMessage().
//    SelectNextTrial() ==> Selects the next trial in the currently defined sequence, based on results provided for the
//       last trial presented.
//    GetTargets() ==> Prepares an array of CXTARGET structs defining all MAESTRO targets in the "target list" for the
//       current trial set.
//    GetChannels() ==> Get object key of the channel config (if any) associated with the currently selected trial.
//    GetTrialInfo() ==>  Prepare an array of TRIALCODEs defining the currently selected trial, as well as the trial
//       target map.  Participating targets are identified by their ordinal pos in this map which, in turn, points to
//       the location of that target's definition in the target list prepared by GetTargets().
//    IsNoFixMode() ==> Is the sequencer's current op mode one of the "no fix" modes?
//    IsStaircaseMode() ==> Is the sequencer currently configured to run a staircase sequence?
//
// ==> Design considerations.
// CCxTrialSequencer is designed as a "helper" class for the sole use of CCxTrialMode. Its design takes into account
// a number of important assumptions about how TrialMode works in MAESTRO:
//    1) While a trial sequence is actually running, the user cannot make any modifications to the MAESTRO document. If
// this was not the case, the sequencer's selection algorithms will fail (they should ASSERT in the DEBUG release).
//    2) The sequencer control parameters (TRIALSEQCTRL) provided in the call to Init() remain in effect until a
// subsequent call to Init() is made. Thus, the user cannot modify these control parameters while a trial sequence is
// running.
//    3) [NO LONGER NECESSARY?:  RMVideo loads targets MUCH FASTER!] Before a trial sequence starts, MAESTRODRIVER's 
// "target list" must be loaded with the definitions of all tgts that may be used by any trial in the trial set. We do 
// this primarily because it is necessary to preload ALL framebuffer video targets participating in a trial sequence 
// prior to starting that sequence. Certain framebuffer targets can take several seconds to load -- which would result 
// in an unacceptably long intertrial interval in framebuffer trial sequences.
//    4) We have elected for now to use large arrays in the MAESTRODRIVER IPC data structure to hold the entire
// target list for the current trial sequence, as well as the trial codes for the current trial. For efficiency's
// sake, GetTargets() and GetTrialInfo() were designed to write directly into these arrays. CCxRuntime::StartTrial()
// and CCxRuntime::LoadTargetList() invoke these methods on a CCxTrialSequencer object passed to them!
//
// REVISION HISTORY:
// 30nov2001-- Introduced CCxTrialSequencer as part of the CCxRuntime module.  It is designed to handle the hard work
//             of sequencing trials and preparing trial & target defns in the format that CXDRIVER "understands".
// 27dec2001-- First version of CCxTrialSequencer done.  More features to be added later.
// 02jan2001-- Moved CCxTrialSequencer to its own source files, CXTRIALSEQ.*.  Also, CCxTrialSequencer will now serve
//             as a helper class to CCxTrialPanel rather than CCxRuntime directly -- although this change is invisible
//             to CCxTrialSequencer.
// 10jan2002-- GetTrialCodes() renamed GetTrialInfo() and modified to prepare a "trial target map".  Now instead of
//             identifying targets in the trial codes by their position in the "current target list", we identify them
//             by their ordinal pos in the map which, in turn, points to their definition in the target list.
// 15jan2002-- GetTrialInfo() modified IAW changes in how open-loop feature is implemented in CCxTrial.  Now, the user
//             must designate a single "open-loop" segment during which the pursuit loop is opened on whatever target
//             is designated as fixation tgt #1 for that segment.  The TARGET_HOPEN trial code is sent only for that
//             segment, if one is specified.  Furthermore, GetTrialInfo() enforces some additional constraints that are
//             intrinsic to the implementation of the open-loop feature during trial runtime:  (1) open-loop is only
//             supported for CX_FIBER1, CX_FIBER2, and XY scope target types CENTER, SURROUND, and RECTDOT.  (2) the
//             tgt selected as fixation tgt #1 during the designated open-loop segment MUST also be selected as the
//             fixation tgt #1 for the remainder of the trial.
// 12feb2002-- A video display configuration object, CCxVideoDsp, now provides the seed used to generate random-dot
//             patterns for XY scope targets.  GetTrialInfo() modified to query that object for a seed.
// 04mar2002-- Implemented the PSGM_TC trial code group in GetTrialInfo().
// 20sep2002-- Updated GetTrialInfo() to support new sacc-trig'd op "select by fix 2".
// 18oct2002-- Removed TRIALSEQCTRL.nRewLen1.  Trial reward length override now in CCxSettings object.  We also use
//             CCxSettings to get the random seed for XY target patterns.  CCxVideoDsp has been superseded by the
//             CCxSettings object.... Also introduced a per-segment "periodic reward" enable flag, and separate H & V
//             fixation accuracies.  See GetTrialInfo() for relevant changes.
// 18dec2002-- Modified GetTrialInfo to encode trial target perturbations via the TARGET_PERTURB trial code group.
// 13jan2003-- RANDOM_SEED trial code now obsolete.  The fixed XY dot seed value and the "auto/fixed" seed flag are
//             sent to CXDRIVER via the CX_SETDISPLAY command, and CXDRIVER handles generation of new seeds when the
//             "auto" flag is set.  GetTrialInfo() updated accordingly.
// 23oct2003-- Updated GetTrialInfo() to support separately enabling velocity stabilization (TARGET_HOPEN trial code
//             group) on the H cmpt only, the V cmpt only, or both components.  See also CXTRIALCODES.H.
// 10mar2004-- Added support for a new control parameter, the global starting position for all targets participating in
//             the trial.  Prior to this change, it was implicitly assumed that all targets started at (0,0), and the
//             user had to set the target window position in segment 0 if s/he wanted the target(s) to start elsewhere.
//             Setting a global starting position allows the user to reuse the same trials to run an experiment in a
//             different part of the subject's or unit's receptive field.  Instead of including them in TRIALSEQCTRL,
//             the H & V components of the global starting position are maintained separately and are NOT reset by
//             the Reset() method.  I want to get rid of TRIALSEQCTRL eventually...
// 05apr2004-- Moved tgt pos/vel transform factors (scale, rotate) and the channel configuration override enable flag
//             and object key out of TRIALSEQCTRL, since these have nothing to do with controlling the sequencer state.
//             They can now be modified between trials even when a sequence is in progress.
// 07apr2004-- Introduced autostop feature.  Sequencer can be configured to autostop after a specified number of trials
//             or trial blocks have been completed.
// 03nov2004-- Mod GetTrialInfo() to support new saccade-trig'd special op, CCxTrial::IsDualFix().
// 25jan2005-- Mod GetTrialInfo() to support new trial code MIDTRIALREW, now required to communicate the mid-trial
//             reward interval and pulse length to CXDRIVER (we no longer use similar parameters from the CCxSettings
//             object!!).  A second version of mid-trial rewards is supported, in which the mid-trial rewards are
//             delivered at the end of each enabled segment rather than at a regular interval during that segment.
// 06apr2005-- Mod GetTrialInfo() to retrieve any tagged sections defined on the selected trial.
// 29apr2005-- Mod GetTrialInfo().  The trial's mark segments now describe a contiguous range of segments representing
//             that portion of the trial to be displayed in Maestro's data trace display.  If one or both is not a
//             valid segment, then the entire trial will be displayed.  GetTrialInfo() now prepares the displayed
//             interval [t0..t1] based on the values of the mark segments.
// 28jul2005-- Updated GetTrialInfo() to support seed parameter for random noise perturbations, and to handle the new
//             noise perturbation type PERT_ISGAUSS.  See CXTRIALCODES.H.
// 16sep2005-- Modified GetTrialInfo() to allow velocity stabilization for any XY scope target type except FCDOTLIFE,
//             FLOWFIELD, and NOISYDOTS.
//          -- Mod to GetNextStaircaseTrial() to force a repeat of last staircase trial if subject fails to respond at
//             all (ie, trial results flag bit CX_FT_NORESP is set).  LogStaircaseStatus() modified to generate a
//             status message that indicates the lack of a response.
// 05dec2005-- Modified GetTrialInfo() to support the new special operation SPECIAL_RPDISTRO and the accompanying
//             trial code RPDWINDOW, which defines one or two reward windows for the operation.
// 07jan2006-- Mods re: new XY tgt type NOISYSPEED.  Also, defined constant NOISYDOTS is now NOISYDIR.
// 11mar2006-- Mod IAW revisions to R/P Distro feature -- now there is only one reward window.
// 13mar2006-- Mod to extend velocity stabilization over a contiguous span of trial segments; change in TARGET_HOPEN
//             trial code usage.  All other restrictions on v.stab. feature still in effect.  See GetTrialInfo().
// 24mar2006-- Mod IAW replacement of VSG-based framebuffer video w/RMVideo.  Since RMVideo is updated on a per-frame 
//             basis like the XY scope, RMVideo targets can participate in any Trial mode "special feature" (most 
//             notably, velocity stabilization) that an XYScope target can.  GetTrialInfo() updated.
// 12apr2006-- GetTrialInfo() modified IAW complete rework of velocity stabilization:  It can now be engaged on a 
//             per-target, per-segment basis using the new TARGET_VSTAB trial code. TARGET_HOPEN is obsolete.
// 19may2006-- Modified to support disabling use of the global tgt pos/vel scale and rotate transforms on a per-trial 
//             basis.  New flags in CCxTrial determine whether or not a global transformation is ignored or not.
// 22sep2006-- GetTrialInfo() modified to fix bug in trial code preparation. If target window vel for seg N is the same 
//             as that for seg N-1, the method did not send a TARGET_*VEL* code, even if target acceleration was 
//             nonzero in seg N. Given the way MaestroDRIVER processes trial codes, the TARGET_*VEL* code is required 
//             if target acceleration is nonzero!
// 01dec2006-- Reordered sequencer modes so that all NOFIX modes are grouped at bottom of list.
// 03jan2007-- Fixed GetTrialInfo() IAW changes in how special operation is identified by CCxTrial -- as integer ID 
//             code TH_SOP_**, defined in CXOBJ_IFC.H. Also, introduced two new operations, TH_SOP_CHOOSEFIX1 and 
//             TH_SOP_CHOOSEFIX2, with implementation constraints like those of the "selectByFix" operations.
// 27feb2007-- Mod GetTrialInfo() to support new trial codes specifying pattern acceleration H,V: INSIDE_*ACC and 
//             INSIDE_*SLOACC.
// 24apr2007-- Updated comments in GetTrialInfo().
// 25apr2007-- Mod to support alternative response measures for RP Distro feature: In the second TRIALCODE of the 
//             SPECIALOP trial code group, when opType == SPECIAL_RPDISTRO, TRIALCODE.code is set to 
//             SPECIAL_RPDISTRO | (rpdRespType << 8), where rpdRespType is the response measure type. For all other 
//             special ops, TRIALCODE.code = opType.  Changed in GetTrialInfo().
// 17jul2008-- Added seq mode "Ordered (Repeat)". In this version of the "Ordered" mode, the sequencer repeatedly 
//             presents the same trial until the subject completes it (ie, satisfy fixation reqmts). Note that there's
//             no "Ordered (Repeat) NOFIX" mode, since that will behave exactly like "Ordered NOFIX".
// 11jan2010-- Mod to GetTrialInfo() to relax restrictions on the velocity stabilization feature.
// 24may2010-- Mod to GetTrialInfo() to support reporting state of trial flag bits to CXDRIVER.
// 11jun2010-- Mod to GetTrialInfo(): Rotate and scale factors are NOT applied to target position in seg 0 IF target is
//             positioned absolutely. For all other segments, factors are applied regardless.
// 21jun2010-- Added seq modes "Wt Ordered" and "Wt Ordered NOFIX" -- like "Ordered", but trial "weights" are respected.
//             Thus, a trial with weight N is presented N times in a row before moving on to the next trial in the
//             ordered list of trials in a set. If trial does not complete successfully, it is repeated -- in which case
//             it could be presented more thant N times in a row... InitRandomReps() -> InitWeightedReps() and 
//             GetNextRandomTrial() -> GetNextWeightedTrial().
// 04oct2010-- Fixed bug: "Wt Ordered NOFIX" mode was not behaving like a NOFIX mode because I had failed to identify
//             it as such in IsNoFixMode().
// 01feb2011-- Mod to GetTrialInfo() to support new special op "searchTask" (TH_SOP_SEARCH, SPECIAL_SEARCH).
// 14mar2011-- Made WasTrialCompleted() public so it can be called by CCxTrialMode::Service().
// 23sep2011-- Removed references to CX_FIBER* in GetTrialInfo(), as CX_FIBER* ande CX_REDLED* are no longer supported
// as of Maestro v3.0.
// 05sep2013-- GetTrialInfo() now aborts if calculated trial duration exceeds MAXTRIALDUR defined in cxtrialcodes.h.
// 01oct2013-- Starting mods to support new sequencer modes "Chained" and "Chained NOFIX". A "trial chain" is the 
//             sequential presentation of N reps of the same trial. In this mode, it is not the sequence of individual
//             trials in the set that are randomized, but the sequence of trial chains. For each trial A with weight N,
//             N chains are included in the sequence: 1A, 2A, 3A, .., NA. Similarly for trial B, C, and so on. 
//          -- Also, CCxTrialSequencer now accumulates the simple trial stats that were handled in CCxTrialStatsDlg,
//             which now keeps a reference to the sequencer and queries it for current stats.
// 04oct2013-- Mod to "Chained" modes: A "failed" trial (animal lost fixation "early enough" that data file was NOT
//             saved) should NOT break a sequence of consecutive reps of the same trial. The only events that reset
//             the consecutive reps counter are: start of sequence, resumption of paused sequence, and change in trial
//             identity.
// 04oct2013-- Mod to "Chained" modes: TRIALSEQCTRL.strChainLens is a parameter specific to the "Chained" seq mode. 
//             The string is a comma-delimited list of integers indicating the different trial chain lengths to run.
//             If empty, then the seq mode works as before: all possible chains 1A - NA, where N is the weight of trial
//             A. Else, it only includes chain lengths that are listed in the string AND are <= N. Thus, if the string
//             is "1,2,4,8" and N=5 for trial A; a block in the sequence will include chains 1A, 2A, and 4A. The string
//             can include the same integer more than once if you want to increase the frequency of one chain length
//             WRT the others: "1,1,1,2,4", e.g. The same string applies to all trials in the set.
// 04dec2014-- Began substantial mods to support two levels of sequencing: ordered or randomized sequencing of trial
// subsets, with ordered or randomized sequencing of the trials within each subset. The other trial sequencing modes 
// ("this trial", staircase, chained) are not allowed when subset sequencing is enabled. When subset sequencing is off, 
// all the trials in the set are sequenced as a single group (even if they're divided into subsets), and all supported 
// trial sequencing modes are available. Effec. v3.1.2.
// 26sep2016-- Updated Init() and GetTrialInfo() to support "trial random variables". Effec. v3.3.0.
// 10oct2016-- Updated Init() so that it calls srand() to seed the basic rand() RNG using the current time. This 
// ensures that each time you restart Maestro, you get a different trial sequence in any mode that uses randomization.
// Prior to this change, you would get the same sequence on successive restarts.
// 22feb2017-- Added seq mode "Randomized Repeat", which is just like the "Randomized" seq mode, except that a failed
// trial is repeated until it is successfully completed. Effec. v3.3.1 (22feb17 rev).
// 05sep2017-- Fix compiler issues while building for 64-bit Win 10 using VStudio 2017.
// 24sep2018-- Mod to GetTrialInfo() to implement RMVideo vertical sync spot flash feature. The previously unused field
// 'time1' in the PULSE_ON code group is set to 1 to request the spot flash at the time specified in 'time0'.
// 07nov2018-- Fixed bug in GetTrialInfo() that caused FIXEYE1 to not be delivered when the mid-trial reward enable
// flag changed (the code was comparing the flag in the current segment against itself instead of the previous segment).
// Regression bug introduced in Sep2016 for V3.3.0. 
// 21mar2019-- Updated to support new trial result flag CX_FT_RMVDUPE, indicating that trial aborted prematurely due to
// a duplicate frame or frames occurring on the RMVideo side. Until now, a duplicate RMVideo frame was treated as an
// CX_FT_ERROR, causing the trial sequence to stop. In the future, if we start using RMVideo displays with refresh
// rates of 120Hz and higher, the chances of the occasional duplicate frame increase -- so we decided that this 
// condition be treated similarly to CX_FT_LOSTFIX. Rather than stopping the trial sequence, the trial data file is
// discarded and the trial is repeated as appropriate to the current sequencer mode.
// 20may2019-- Updated Init() and GetTrialInfo() to implement random reward withholding variable ratio feature for 
// individual trials. CCxTrial manages the runtime state for the feature, but CCxTrialSequencer must call the relevant
// CCxTrial methods to initialize, query and update the runtime state as trials are sequenced. To signal a withheld
// reward to CXDRIVER, GetTrialInfo() sets the reward pulse length to 0 in the relevant trial code.
// 03nov2022-- Updated to support new trial result flag CX_FT_EYELINKERR, indicating that trial aborted prematurely due
// to an Eyelink tracker communication error. Like CX_FT_RMVDUPE, this is considered a non-fatal error that should not
// terminate trial sequencing.

//
//    17jul2008: ORDERED_REPEAT sequencer mode added. This is the same as ORDERED, except that a failed trial (LOST_FIX
//    result flag) is presented over and over until the subject "passes" the trial. Of course, this means that a trial 
//    "block" can contain many more trial presentations than there are trials defined in the current trial set!
//

//    times in a row, where N = trial's weight. Thus, zero-wt trials are not presented. Also, a trial may be presented
//    more than N times because it is repeated each time it fails to complete successfully.
//
//    02oct2013: CHAINED, CHAINED_NF modes added. See GetNextChainedTrial() for details. In addition, trial stats 
//    (#attempts, #completed, and #reps of a given chain length for CHAINED modes) are updated here. This works because
//    SelectNextTrial() is always called immediately after finishing a trial, successfully or not.
//
//    04dec2014: Introduced trial subsets and a second level of sequencing: ordered or random sequencing of the subsets
//    comprising the trial set. Two sequence modes are specified by user: the manner in which trial subsets are 
//    sequenced, and the way in which the trials in the current subset are sequenced. Some trial sequencing modes are
//    only available when subset sequencing is OFF.
//
//    22feb2017: RANDOM_REPEAT sequencer mode added. Same as RANDOM, except that a failed trial (LOST_FIX result flag)
//    is presented over and over until the subject "passes" the trial. 
//
//    21mar2019: New trial result flag bit CX_FT_RMVDUPE indicates that trial aborted because too many duplicate frames
//    were detected by RMVideo during the trial (either a single duplicate, or more than 3 if user selected the option
//    to allow as many as 3 duplicate frames). Prior to this, any duplicate frame was treated as a fatal error 
//    (CX_FT_ERROR), thereby terminating the trial sequence. Now, trial sequencing continues on the CX_FT_RMVDUPE 
//    result. For most sequencer modes, the failed trial is repeated (or not) IAW the mode's rules, same as for 
//    CX_FT_LOSTFIX. For the Chained and Staircase modes, a CX_FT_RMVDUPE trial is treated as though it never happened.
//
//    03nov2022: New trial result flag bit CX_FT_EYELINKERR indicates that trial aborted because of an Eyelink tracker
//    communication error. This is treated as a non-fatal error, same as CX_FT_RMVDUPE.

/** WasTrialCompleted =================================================================================================
Does the trial result flags indicate that the trial completed successfully? 

A trial is "completed" if no fatal error occurred, the trial did not stop prematurely because duplicate video frames 
occurred on the RMVideo display or because of an Eyelink tracker communication error, and the subject did not lose 
fixation (or the sequencer mode does not enforce fixation). In the CHAINED sequencer mode, the condition is somewhat 
weaker: the trial is "completed" so long as no error occurred and the data file was saved, even if the subject lost
fixation.

NOTE that when an error occurs, the trial sequence will be stopped. Prior to 21mar2019, a duplicate frame event in
RMVideo was treated as an error; now it is treated like a "lost fix" condition in most sequencer modes.

As of 03nov2022, an Eyelink tracker communication error is treated like an RMVideo duplicate frame event. These two 
kinds of "errors" generally are NOT fatal errors, so it is better to simply discard the failed trial and continue 
trial sequencing.

@param dwTrialRes The trial result flags.
@return TRUE if flags indicate that trial completed successfully, as described.

//

//    "global overrides" and translation/rotation factors in effect (part of the sequencer's control parameters).  Any
//    tagged sections defined on the selected trial are also provided.
//
//    Participating targets are identified within the trial codes by their ordinal position in the trial target map,
//    which is merely a list of indices pointing to the corresponding target's definition in the "loaded target list"
//    that is prepared by GetTargets().
//
//    On "special" operations and XY scope target interleaving:  These two optional features of a Maestro trial have
//    implementation constraints that cannot easily be enforced while the user is defining the trial.  Instead, we
//    check & enforce the constraints here, returning FALSE if a constraint is violated.  Briefly, the limitations are:
//       1) A trial involving a special operation OTHER THAN "R/P Distro" cannot use the turntable (CX_CHAIR); it is 
//          not compatible with this feature.  The "R/P Distro" does NOT have this constraint because it does not 
//          involve changing the trial's timeline at runtime.
//       2) A "selectByFix" or "chooseFix" trial MUST specify fixation targets 1 & 2 during the designated special 
//          segment. The same fixation targets must be specified for all remaining segments after the special segment.
//       2a) A "searchTask" trial must have more than one participating target, must specify fixation target 1 during
//          the special segment, and must specify a non-zero grace period for that segment that is strictly less than
//          the segment's minimum duration.
//       3) Let N = # of XY scope targets to be interleaved during trial, and segDT(m) be the XY scope frame period
//          during segment m.  Then it must be true that:
//          a) There are at least N XY scope targets participating in the trial, not including any of the type RECTDOT,
//             which is exempt from interleaving.
//          b) For all segments of the trial, segDT(m) % N == 0 and segDT(m)/N is a multiple of the minimum frame
//             period SGH_MINXYFRAME.
//
//    Velocity stabilization (TARGET_VSTAB) can be engaged on a per-target, per-segment basis. Prior to V2.5.2, it was
//    supported for all XY scope target types except FCDOTLIFE, FLOWFIELD, NOISYDIR and NOISYSPEED, and all RMVideo 
//    target types except RMV_MOVIE. As of V2.5.2 (Jan 2010), these restrictions are removed, with some caveats:
//       1) The finite dot-life targets (XYScope FCDOTLIFE, NOISYDIR and NOISYSPEED; RMVideo's Random-Dots Patch) 
//    targets won't behave correctly when the finite dotlife is expressed in degrees travelled. 
//       2) Only the target window position of the XYScope optical flow field target FLOWFIELD is adjusted for velocity 
//    stabilization. The flow velocity will be unaffected.
//       3) In RMVideo, target pattern motion is almost always WRT the target's center, not the screen center. So,
//    velocity stabilization of these targets is achieved simply by adjusting the target's window motion. Users should
//    be aware of this difference. There is one exception: the RMV_RANDOMDOTS target type with flag RMV_F_WRTSCREEN set.
//    In this case, both pattern and window motion are WRT the screen center, and both are adjusted when velocity 
//    stabilization is engaged.
//       4) Velocity stabilization of CHAIR makes no sense and is not allowed. In this case, this method will not
//    generate the trial codes and will abort on an error.
//
//    Maximum trial duration check: Since v3.0, MAESTRODRIVER calculates trial trajectories on the fly, eliminating the
//    need for large buffers and making very long trials possible. However, one obstacle remains: the trial codes store
//    elapsed trial times as short integers. Thus, we restrict trial length to a value, MAXTRIALDUR, less than the max
//    value of a signed 16-bit integer.
//
//    BACKGROUND:  MAESTRODRIVER has no knowledge of Maestro data objects like CCxTrial and CCxTarget.  Instead Maestro 
//    must convert those data objects into a form that MAESTRODRIVER "understands".  A Maestro trial object is conveyed 
//    to MAESTRODRIVER as a sequence of trial codes, which are detailed in CXTRIALCODES.H.  This scheme was adopted 
//    from the original incarnation of Maestro, in which the GUI ran on a UNIX workstation and transmitted these trial 
//    codes (as well as other information and commands) over the network to a Windows PC that communicated with the 
//    Maestro hardware and executed all experimental protocols.
//
//    02oct2013: Trial state flags related to the new CHAINED sequencer modes. Added two flags, THF_CHAINED and 
//    THF_CHAINSTART, in CXOBJ_IFC.H. These are not set as part of the trial's definition. Instead, they are set only
///   by this sequencer object to (a) mark a trial that is part of a chained sequence, and (b) mark those trials in a
//    chained sequence that are the first trial in a chain (1 or more identical trials presented consecutively). Four
//    kinds of events mark the end of one trial chain and the beginning of another: (1) The trial sequence just 
//    started. (2) A paused trial sequence is resumed. (3) The last trial failed because subject broke fixation AND
//    the trial data file was NOT saved (failsafe segment not reached). (4) The previous trial was different.
//
//    26sep2016: Added support for trial random variables. We call CCxTrial::UpdateRVs() to get the next "value" for
//    each active random variable defined on the trial. This could fail if a function-type RV cannot be evaluated, in
//    which case trial sequencing should be aborted. Once the RVs have been updated, any segment table parameter that 
//    is assigned to an RV takes on that RV's current value for the purposes of generating the trial codes -- see the
//    CCxTrial::GetCurr***() methods. The parameters that may be governed by an RV: segment duration, or any of the 10
//    target trajectory parameters.
//
//    NOTE: We implicitly assume for now that the timebase for the trial is 1msec.  Hence, the projected duration in
//    msecs is the same as the duration in # of frames.

//=== InitWeightedReps, GetNextWeightedTrial ===========================================================================
//
//    The RANDOM and WT_ORDERED sequencer modes take into account each trial's weight.
//
//    In the RANDOM modes, trials are presented randomly with frequency of presentation determined by the trial weight.
//    Thus, a trial with a weight of 10 is presented a total of 10 times over the course of a trial "block", while a
//    a trial with a weight of 1 is only presented once during that block, and a trial with weight 0 is not presented
//    at all. In the WT_ORDERED modes, the scenario is similar, except that trials are presented in the order listed in
//    the trial set, and each trial is presented N times in a row, where N is the trial's weight.
//
//    To implement the random selection scheme, an internal array tracks the # of reps remaining for each trial, 
//    as well as the total # of trial reps remaining in a trial "block".  At the start of a trial block, each array 
//    element is initialized to the corresponding trial's  weight.  To randomly choose a trial, we pick a random # 
//    between 0 and the total # of trial reps remaining (minus one).  We then step thru the "remaining reps" array, 
//    accumulating the #reps until we've reached our randomly selected #.  The position in the array at which we stop is
//    the index of the trial selected.
//
//    For the ordered and weighted selection scheme, we decrement the #reps remaining for a trial each time that trial
//    completes successfully. Once that hits zero, we step forward to the next trial in the set.
//
//    We only decrement the #reps remaining for a given trial when that trial is successfully completed (ie, no error
//    occurs and the subject satisfies the trial's fixation requirements, if any).  A trial "block" is complete when
//    the "remaining reps" array contains all zeros.  When this happens, we reinitialize the array and start over with
//    a new block, and the "block done" flag is set in the trial results field.
//
//    As of v3.1.2 (Dec 2014), the trial sequencer supports two levels of sequencing. A trial subset object was 
//    introduced in the MAESTRO object tree. Trials can now appear as children of trial sets or trial subsets. A trial
//    set can have any combination of trials and trial subsets as immediate children, although the intent is to group
//    trials into subsets when the experiment protocol warrants. 
//
//    When a trial set contains at least one non-empty subset (and typically more than one!!), the user specifies TWO
//    sequencing modes: one for the subsets and one for the trials within a subset. When subset sequencing is enabled,
//    these two methods perform similar work, but they act only on the trials within a subset. Once the trials for the
//    current subset have been presented IAW the trial sequencing mode, the next subset is chosen and the process
//    repeats. A trial "block" is completed when all of the defined subsets have been presented, at which point a new
//    block begins.
//
//    As of v3.3.1 (Feb 2017 revision), the RANDOM_REPEAT sequencer mode was added. This is just like RANDOM, except
//    that a failed trial is repeated over and over again until the subject completes it.
//
//    For GetNextWeightedTrial()--
//    ARGS:       dwTrialRes  -- [in/out] results from the last trial run (ignored when first trial of seq is chosen).

//=== InitChainedReps, GetNextChainedTrial ============================================================================
//
//    In the CHAINED modes, instead of presenting the individual trials in a set randomly, trial "chains" are presented
//    randomly. A trial chain is a sequence of 1 or more consecutive presentations of the SAME trial. The number of 
//    different-length chains is determined by two parameters: the string TRIALSEQCTRL.strChainLens and the trial's
//    weight.
//   
//    The string parameter is a comma-delimited list of integers indicating the different chain lengths to be included
//    in one block of a chained sequence. This list applies to all participating trials, but any chain length larger
//    than the trial's weight is ignored. Furthermore, if a particular length appear N times in the list, then that 
//    chain length will be represented N times in the block of chains, for each trial with weight W >= N. This gives 
//    the user control over which trial chains are presented, and the relative frequency of different-length chains.
//    The minimum integer allowed is 1, and the maximum is 255. Any integer outside this range is skipped.
//
//    If the string parameter is empty (or contains no valid integers), then the sequencer will include chains of
//    length 1, 2, .., W for a trial with weight W, and analogously for all other trials in the sequenced set. 
//
//    An example should clarify these concepts: Let the trial set contain 3 trials: A (wt=5), B (wt=10), C (wt=1).
//    If the strChainLens parameter is an empty string, then one block in the sequence contains the chains 1A, 2A, 3A,
//    4A, 5A, 1B, 2B, .., 10B, and 1C. If strChainLens="1,2,2,4,8", then the chains in one block are: 1A, 2A, 2A, 4A,
//    1B, 2B, 2B, 4B, 8B, 1C.
//
//    The motivation behind this sequencer mode (introduced in V3.1.0, Oct 2013) is to detect improvement in the
//    subject's performance of a task with repetition.
//
//    To initialize the chained sequence, we generate the list of distinct chains to be presented in one "block". A
//    single chain is characterized by the key of the trial to be presented, and the number of times it should be
//    presented in a row. This list is then shuffled in random order. During sequencing, we step through this list
//    from beginning to end; for each chain in the list, we present the specified trial the specified number of times 
//    in a row before moving on to the next chain. Once all chains have been presented, the block is complete, and 
//    we reshuffle the same list to start the next block.
//
//    NOTE that all the individual trials in a particular chain are presented before moving onto the next chain, even 
//    if the animal does not complete one or more trials in that chain. Unlike in the RANDOM and WT_ORDERED modes, the 
//    trial result usually has NO bearing on what the sequencer does next.
//
//    [21mar2019] There is one exception. If the trial did not complete because a duplicate frame was detected on the
//    RMVideo display (result flag CX_FT_RMVDUPE), then this trial is treated as though it never happened. The current
//    chain's length is not incremented, nor is the current success chain length.
//
//    ARGS:       dwTrialRes  -- [in/out] results from the last trial run (ignored when first trial of seq is chosen).
//
//    RETURNS:    TRUE if successful; FALSE if an error occurred while initializing chained sequence.

//=== InitStaircases ==================================================================================================
//
//    Prepare runtime parameters for sequencing trials in one of the STAIRCASE modes, based on the current staircase
//    sequence control parameters.
//
//    BACKGROUND:  The staircase trial sequence is intended for visual psychophysics protocols in which the next trial
//    selected is based upon the subject's response to the last trial.  This function sets up a scheme which governs
//    trial selection.  Each trial can be designated as a member of one of MAX_STAIRS different "staircases", or as a
//    "NORMAL" trial (id=0).  Trials in the former category are staircase trials, marked for participation in one of
//    up to MAX_STAIRS different interleaved staircase sequences.  Each trial in a particular staircase has a 'stimulus
//    strength' associated with it.  Trials of the same strength make up a single 'tier' of that staircase.  All NORMAL
//    trials in the current trial set do not participate in any staircase and form the so-called "irrelevant tier".
//    The main job of this function is to build this multiple-staircase, tiered representation from the original list
//    of trials in the current trial set.   Here's how we do it:
//       1) On first pass thru trial set, we segregate the trials into the irrelevant tier or one of the staircases.
//          Trials belonging to a staircase are sorted into different tiers based on the "staircase stimulus strength"
//          associated with the trial.  Each time we encounter a staircase trial to which a new stimulus strength is
//          assigned, we must create a new tier; the new tier is inserted into the staircase's tier array  so that
//          tiers are in ascending order of stimulus strength.  If a staircase trial belongs to an existing tier, then
//          the #trials in that tier is incremented.
//       2) On second pass, we use the tier info to resort the trials in the set into the following prescribed order:
//          [ irrelevant tier trials, stair 1 tier 1 trials (weakest), ..., stair 1 tier M trials (strongest),
//          stair 2 tier 1, etc].  We also sum the trial weights for each tier.
//    The staircase and tier info, along with the sorted array of trial keys, is later used to randomly select a trial
//    from a given tier IAW the assigned trial weights.
//
//    Note that the algorithm is designed to preserve memory at the expense of computational time.
//
//    A staircase trial sequence will not work correctly if the trials are not properly defined.  Every trial (incl
//    NORMAL ones) must satisfy certain constraints, as validated by CheckStaircaseTrial().
//
//    RETURNS:  TRUE if it successfully resorted trials and initialized runtime params for the staircase sequencing;
//              FALSE if the current trial set does not support staircase sequencing.

//
//    Update the sequencer's runtime state in the STAIRCASE modes and select the next trial to run, taking into account
//    subject's response to the last trial presented in the sequence.  If all staircases satisfy the stop condition,
//    the sequencer auto-stops -- setting the CX_SEQSTOP in the trial results field -- and the next trial is undefined.
//
//    The sequencer can interleave up to MAX_STAIRS distinct staircases simultaneously.  In addition, trials in the set
//    that are not associated with a staircase ("irrelevant" trials) can be presented randomly a specified percentage
//    of the time.  See InitStaircases() for a more detailed description.
//
//    Currently, we use an "N-up, M-down" decision algorithm to step up or down each staircase.  When the subject
//    responds incorrectly to N consecutive trials from a given staircase tier, we take a step up the staircase to the
//    next higher-strength tier.  When the subject responds correctly to M consecutive trials from a tier, we take a
//    step down the staircase to the next lower-strength tier.  A staircase is considered "done" when the staircase
//    direction (up, down) has reversed a specified # of times (part of the sequencer's control params).
//
//    If the subject fails to respond to a staircase trial, correctly or incorrectly, then the trial is repeated.
//
//    [21mar2019] A new trial result flag, CX_FT_RMVDUPE, indicates that the trial stopped prematurely because a
//    duplicate frame (or frames) was detected on the RMVideo display. If trial is "irrelevant", it is not repeated and
//    the staircase message will indicate and error occurred.
//
//    [03nov2022] Added trial result flag, CX_FT_EYELINKERR, indicating the trial stopped prematurely because of an
//    Eyelink communication tracker error. Like the RMVideo duplicate frame error, this is typically a transient,
//    non-fatal error that does NOT terminate trial sequencing. Both errors are treated the same way by the staircase
//    trial sequencer: a failed irrelevant trial is repeated, but a failed staircase trial is.

//=== LogStaircaseStatus ==============================================================================================

//    Posts messages regarding the status of an ongoing staircase sequence.  Possible status codes:
//
//       STAIR_SEQSTOP  ==> Sequence stopped.  Compute estimated stimulus strength threshold (if possible) for each
//          staircase that was running and post appropriate message.  We define the threshold as the average strength
//          over the # of reversals that have occurred.  if no reversals have occurred, this threshold is undefined.
//       STAIR_ERRLOSTFIX ==> Error or fixation break.  If last trial was not "irrelevant", it is repeated.
//       STAIR_NORESP   ==> Subject failed to respond to last trial.  If not "irrelevant", trial will  be repeated.
//       STAIR_WRONG    ==> Incorrect response to the last trial presented.
//       STAIR_OK       ==> Correct response to the last trial.
//       STAIR_DONE + N ==> Staircase sequence #(N+1) has just satisfied stop condition (N = [0..MAX_STAIRS-1]).
//
//    The status msg composed for status codes _REDO, _WRONG, and _OK contains the following fields:
//       ch 0-6   ==> "N:MMMM ", where N is the staircase # (1-5) and MMMM is the # of trials from this staircase that
//                    have been presented so far.  N = 0 for irrelevant trials.
//       ch 7-26  ==> first 20 chars of trial name (left-aligned, completed with blanks)
//       ch 27-29 ==> ":  "
//       ch 30-44 ==> for staircase trials, this lists the strength of the trial (right-aligned, out to 3 sig figs,
//                    preceded with blanks) and one of four possible results:  "norsp", "right", "wrong", or "error".
//                    The first of these results indicates that subject failed to respond at all.  The last indicates
//                    that an error occurred, or the subject lost fixation.  In either case, the trial is repeated.
//                    For irrelevant trials, this reads "**irrel*" followed by "norsp", "right", "wrong", or "error".
//                    Note that irrelevant trials are not repeated.
