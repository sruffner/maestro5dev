/** rmvtarget.cpp =====================================================================================================
 Implementation of class CRMVTarget, representing any RMVideo target.

 CRMVTarget defines a target that can be drawn and animated on the RMVideo display. It handles initialization of the
 target object from the RMVideo target definition structure, RMVTGTDEF, including allocation of any special resources
 needed to render the target (texture, internal arrays for maintaining random-dot information, resources for streaming 
 frames from a video file, and so on). During an animation sequence, updateMotion() updates the target's state IAW
 the motion update vector provided, while draw() renders the target in accordance with its current state.

 In the OGL1.1-compatible incarnation of RMVideo, CRMVTarget was an abstract class, and a separate concrete class was
 developed for each target type. In the OGL3.3 implementation, the "one class per target type" design was discarded,
 and CRMVTarget was redesigned to handle all supported RMVideo target types. In addition, CRMVTarget is designed to
 work closely with CRMVRenderer, a singleton object which sets up the OpenGL rendering infrastructure and provides 
 methods for actually rendering the target into the current OpenGL "backbuffer". It hides the details of OpenGL from
 CRMVTarget. Through CRMVRenderer methods, CRMVTarget acquires and loads any texture object needed for rendering, 
 reserves a portion of the vertex array allocated at startup and shared among all targets during an animation sequence,
 and uploads vertex or texture data. During each animation frame, in its draw() call, CRMVTarget relies on CRMVRenderer
 methods to update the values of relevant shader uniform variables, then draw the primitives defined in the segment of
 the vertex array dedicated to the target.

 A note on coordinates/units: All RMVideo targets are sized, positioned, and animated in Maestro-centric coordinates
 -- visual degrees subtended at the subject's eye. The origin lies at the center of the screen, the horizontal axis
 increasing rightward, and the vertical axis increasing upward (the subject's line of sight, when fixating the origin,
 should intersect the plane of the screen at a normal angle). 

 ==> Implementation Notes for RMV_IMAGE
 All image source files, like the video files for RMV_MOVIE targets, are maintained in RMVideo's "media store", a 
 series of folders under the CRMVMediaMgr::MEDIASTOREDIR directory in RMVideo's installation directory, which is always
 the "current working directory" when RMVideo is running. Media files, whether images or videos, are typically
 downloaded from Maestro over its private Ethernet link with RMVideo, although it is certainly possible to copy files
 directly from CD or DVD media (or other means) onto the RMVideo machine's file system. A media file is identified by
 its file name "file.ext" and the name of its parent folder "folderName"; its file-system pathname is then
 "$RMVIDEO_HOME/media/folderName/file.ext". Media folder and file name restrictions apply. See the RMVideo media store
 store manager object CRMMediaMgr and RMVIDEO_COMMON.H for more information.

 At initialization, CRMVTarget attempts to load the image data from the image file specified by the folder and file
 names that are part of the target definition. If succesful, the image is bound to a texture (and thus stored in
 onboard memory on the graphics card). The image rectangle's width and height are computed in visual degrees subtended
 at the eye, using information from the RMVideo target renderer, CRMVRenderer.

 The image is always loaded in GL_RGBA pixel format, even if the source file is in a different format; thus,
 transparency/translucency IS supported. Supported image file formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, PSD (Photoshop), and GIF. Note
 that CRMVMediaMgr relies on the STB_IMAGE.H library for image file loading; it does not support all the various 
 nuances of these image formats. It is always critical that users test their images before employing them in an actual
 experiment.

 ==> Implementation Notes for RMV_MOVIE
 All video files are maintained in RMVideo's "media store", as described above for the RMV_IMAGE target.

 At initialization, CRMVTarget relies on the renderer's video streamer, CVidBuffer, to open the video file and 
 initiate buffering of frames on a background thread. If the video stream is successfully opened, CVidBuffer returns
 a stream ID that is used in future calls to retrieve video frames sequentially. [CVidBuffer was introduced to enhance
 throughput for videos in hopes that RMVideo would be able to handle larger movie frame sizes at higher refresh 
 rates.] During an animation sequence, playback does not begin until the target is turned on (all targets are off at
 t=0). At that point, updateMotion() retrieves the first movie frame from the file and uploads the pixel data to the 
 OpenGL texture that was allocated during the initialization phase. When CRMVRenderer.drawTarget() renders the target,
 a simple quad is drawn equal to the size of the movie frame and the texture containing the movie frame is mapped onto
 it. The location of the quad can vary from frame to frame -- so it is possible to pan the "movie window" during 
 animation. This process repeats until the last frame is retrieved from the video file or the animation ends.

 With the video stream buffering in place, we hit another bottleneck in testing -- the speed with which frame data can
 be uploaded to the dedicated texture object on the video card. To address this problem, we introduced a round-robin 
 queue of 3 pixel buffer objects. Each video frame is uploaded to the texture via a pixel buffer. Frame N is copied to
 an available pixel buffer during the updateMotion() call for frame N-1; then during the call for frame N, that pixel
 buffer is uploaded to the texture. This scheme lets the driver DMA the pixel buffer contents to the video card at the
 same time that the CPU is memcpy()-ing the next frame to another pixel buffer. This change brought a significant 
 improvement in performance.

 Three flags in the target definition affect video playback behavior. They can be used in any combination.
    RMV_F_REPEAT: If this flag is set, the movie loops indefinitely during the animation sequence. CVidBuffer will
 always returns to the beginning of the video and starts over once it retrieves the last frame. This makes looping
 very simple. The movie will play over and over until the animation sequence stops. If the flag is not set, the movie 
 is played back only once.
    RMV_F_PAUSEWHENOFF: By design, Maestro trial targets continue to move when they are turned off. In keeping with 
 this principle, an RMV_MOVIE target continues "playing" the movie (but not rendering the frame) if the target is off
 -- unless this flag is set. In that case, playback is paused until the target is turned on again. Note that, 
 regardless the state of this flag, movie playback does not begin until the first time the target is turned on during
 an animation sequence.
    RMV_F_ATDISPRATE: The video file will typically include information about the rate at which movie frames should be
 presented. This rate is set when the video is created. Typical playback rates are 24 or 30Hz. If this flag is NOT set
 and the playback rate is known, CRMVTarget will attempt to play the movie at that rate as best it can. Since the 
 RMVideo monitor refresh rate may vary with the installation and with the selected video mode, it is likely that the
 refresh rate will not be an even multiple of the target playback rate, so some "jitter" is unavoidable. If this flag
 is set OR the playback rate is not available, CRMVTarget will draw a new movie frame for every display update, so the
 movie playback rate will equal the monitor refresh rate. Naturally, the playback rate chosen will affect the duration
 of the movie!

 ************* SUMMARY OF PEFORMANCE TESTING, Oct 2019 ****************************************************************
 24oct2019-- I spent the better part of a month trying various techniques to further improve the performance of 
 RMVideo when playing large videos (1024x768 or greater) at an update rate of 120Hz. The two changes which made the
 greatest impact:
   1) Implementing a round-robin queue of 3 pixel buffer objects to upload video frames to the target texture.
   2) Setting the scheduling policy of CVidBuffer's background buffering thread to SCHED_OTHER instead of SCHED_FIFO.
 It was also important that the video source contain only a single video stream and no audio. A 1280x720 video 
 containing an audio track exhibited much more frequent duplicate frame errors than one without.

 Here are some of the techniques I tried to further improve performance over the round-robin of 3 PBOs:
    a) Round-robin of 3 PBOs plus an alternating pair of texture objects -- so that one texture is loaded with the
 next video frame while the other is used to draw the current frame. 
    b) Instead of 3 PBOs, tried a single PBO large enough to hold 3 frames. Used GL_MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT with 
 glMapBufferRange() and used fence sync objects with glClientWaitSync() to ensure we didn't write to a segment of
 the PBO that was still in use. Testing indicated that we never had to wait in glClientWaitSync().
    c) Tried a similar technique as (b), but using a persistently mapped pixel buffer. This requires OpenGL 4.4 (or
 the relevant extension), uses glBufferStorage() to allocate immutable storage for the pixel buffer. The memory 
 address for the buffer is mapped during target initialization via glMapBufferRange() with the flags GL_MAP_WRITE_BIT,
 MAP_PERSISTENT_BIT and MAP_COHERENT_BIT. Then that buffer can be used during target animation without constantly
 mapping and unmapping. It does again require the fence syncs to avoid writing to a segment of the buffer that is
 still in use by the OpenGL driver or the GPU.
    d) Tried to move the memcpy() that copies the next video frame into a PBO (or segment of a single 3x PBO) into
 the CVidBuffer thread. This required passing the mapped pixel buffer memory to CVidBuffer. It was rather tricky
 (got seg faults and race conditions initially), and it did not improve performance at all.
    e) Implemented a PBO pool -- the idea being that frequent allocation/deallocation of PBOs when running a trial
 set with lots of RMV_MOVIE targets was causing memory fragmentation that the driver had to "clean up" once in a
 while, leading to delays that resulted in duplicate frame errors.

28oct2019-- Tried one more idea: A single, large persistently mapped PBO that is segmented as needed to provide 
3-PBO queues for any RMV_MOVIE targets. The PBO was large enough to handle a single 2560x1440 or 1920x1080 video,
or multiple simultaneous videos at lower resolutions. This strategy did not measurably improve performance.

Again, NONE of these strategies offered a performance improvement over the basic round-robin queue of 3 PBOs (combined
with the CVidBuffer thread running with a normal scheduling policy). Furthermore, there were two test trials that,
by far, caused the most duplicate frame errors during testing. Both involved simultaneous playback of two movies. The
most problematic trial played two 1024x768 movies; the other had a 720x480 movie and a 352x288 movie. Trials playing
back a single video -- even 1920x1080 @ 120Hz -- rarely aborted. This suggests that there's a fair amount of overhead
in playing back two videos simultaneously (two asynchronous PBO->texture uploads, blitting from two different 
textures, more OGL state changes) that leads to poorer performance.

************* SUMMARY OF PEFORMANCE TESTING, Oct 2019 ****************************************************************

==> Implementation Notes for RMV_RANDOMDOTS
 RMVideo target type RMV_RANDOMDOTS represents a random-dot pattern windowed by a rectangular, elliptical, or annular
 aperture; a 2D Gaussian window may be applied (unless aperture is annular). The dot pattern moves independently of the
 target window itself, and the number of dots within the outer boundary of the aperture is a specified constant [but
 note that, for oval and annular apertures, some percentage of the dots will lie outside the aperture or be hidden by
 the "hole" in the aperture). Each dot in the pattern has the same RGB color (except in two-color constrast mode; see
 below), and dot size is restricted to [1..10] pixels. The target implements several special features:
   1) Percent coherence -- A specified percentage N% of the dots in the pattern move coherently during each update
 frame. This effect is achieved by randomly repositioning 100-N% of the dots on each update.
   2) Randomized finite dotlife -- If the target is assigned a nonzero maximum dot lifetime N, then each dot is
 initially assigned a random lifetime in [0..N]. Dotlife may be expressed in milliseconds or in degrees travelled. On
 each update frame, each dot's lifetime is decremented appropriately. When its dotlife expires, the dot is randomly
 repositioned within the target aperture, and its dotlife is reset to N.
   3) Per-dot speed or direction noise -- Normally, whenever the target pattern velocity V is nonzero, all dots in the
 pattern move with that velocity. However, if the target is assigned a nonzero noise update interval M, noise is added
 to the SPEED OR DIRECTION of each and every dot in the pattern. Every M milliseconds, the velocity vector of each dot
 is altered WRT the pattern velocity vector. In the case of direction noise, the dot velocity vector is the pattern
 velocity rotated by some angle D chosen randomly from the range [-N..N] (in whole degrees). N is the noise range limit
 and is restricted to [0..180]; the larger its value, the greater the directional noise. A uniform RNG is used to
 select the direction offset D for each dot.
    In the case of speed noise, there are now (as of Maestro v2.1.3) two alternative algorithms for noise generation. 
 In the original "additive" noise algorithm, the magnitude of the dot velocity vector is set to R=Ro + n*Ro/1000, where
 Ro is the pattern speed and n is the %-age noise factor randomly chosen from [-N:N] in 1% increments. Again, a uniform
 RNG is used, and N is restricted to [0..300]. In the multiplicative algorithm, R = Ro*2^n, where the exponent n is
 randomly chosen from [-N>>N], again using a uniform RNG. N is restricted to [1..7], and the range [-N..N] is divided
 into 100 equal bins.
    IMPORTANT: The per-dot direction or speed noise is selected every M milliseconds REGARDLESS the target's on/off
 state and even if its pattern velocity is zero. Take this into account in any offline computation of the target dots'
 trajectories during the animation!
   4) Flag RMV_F_WRTSCREEN (effective RMVideo v3, Jan 2010). When this flag is set, the target pattern displacment
 vector is specified WRT the screen center rather than the target window's center, as is normally the case. This flag
 was introduced so that RMV_RANDOMDOTS could better emulate the XYScope NOISYDIR and NOISYSPEED targets when both
 target and pattern are moving with the same nominal velocity vector. Prior to this change, you had to set pattern
 velocity to zero for the dots to move with the window, which meant that the dots would no longer be "noisy"!
   5) Two-color constrast mode. If the contrast C is non-zero for the target's R, G or B color component, then two
 distinct colors are defined: L1=M(1+C) and L2=M(1-C), where C=[0..1] and M is the nominal or mean luminance. Half the
 dots in the patch are drawn in one color, the rest in the other color.

 NOTE that the "aperture" is NOT implemented by alpha blending with an alpha mask texture -- as is the case for the
 RMV_SPOT, _GRATING, and _PLAID. Instead, on every frame, we compute each dot's alpha based on its current location and
 the aperture type. If a dot's center lies outside the aperture, its alpha is 0, else it is 1 (unless a Gaussian mask
 is specified, of course). The per-dot alpha is stored in the vertex attribute that normally holds the X-coordinate Tx
 of the dot's corresponding texel location. The monolithic fragment shader handles this special case, ignoring the 
 result of the texture operation and setting the fragment alpha to Tx.

==> Implementation Notes for RMV_FLOWFIELD
 The RMVideo target type RMV_FLOWFIELD represents a simple optical flow field of randomly located dots flowing radially
 toward or away from a "focus of expansion", or FOE. Each dot moves at a different speed depending on its radial
 distance from the FOE. The field is a circular annulus; the inner hole is necessary because dot velocity goes to zero
 as it approaches the FOE. This target recognizes only pattern motion; the FOE is ALWAYS located at the center of the
 screen, since the implementation assumes that the subject's line-of-sight passes through the screen plane at the FOE 
 at a perpendicular angle.
 
 Animation calculations: A single parameter, RMVTGTVEC.hPat, defines the per-frame motion of the flow field. This
 parameter is interpreted as deltaR, the change in radial position of a dot at a radius r2 = 1/2 the outer radius of
 the flow field. Both deltaR and r2 are specified in visual deg subtended at the eye. From these the method
 updateFlowField() calculates

    B = deltaR / (sin(r2) * cos(r2)).

 Then, the change in radial position dR of any dot at radius R in the flow field is dR = B*sin(R)*cos(R). After the new
 radial position of the dot is updated, we must check to make sure it has not exceeded the field's inner or outer radii
 (negative flows move toward the FOE, while positive flows emanate from it) -- in which case the dot is "recycled",
 because the number of dots in the flow field is a constant.

 Dot recycling is probably the trickiest part of the implementation; we adopted the same algorithms used for the flow
 field target implemented on Maestro's XY scope controller. The goal is to recycle the dots at an appropriate rate and
 in an appropriate manner so that the dot density over the field stays relatively uniform. For accelerating flows, this
 was not difficult -- when a dot's radius exceeds the outer edge, we merely relocate it anywhere in the field. 
 Decelerating flows (negative value for B) were not so easy. Because the dots slow down as they approach the FOE, they
 tend to accumulate there, and the previous recycling algorithm fails miserably. After some trial and error, we came up
 with a heuristic algorithm that yielded the best performance over the widest range of flowfield radii and values of B
 (which takes into account both frame rate and the flow velocity magnitude). Basically, the probability that a dot will
 be recycled during a given update frame is the product of two probabilities -- one that increases with the magnitude
 of B, and one that increases with decreasing radius. If it is recycled, the dot's angle is randomized in [0..360), 
 while its radius is randomized within an annulus at the outer edge of the field, between r = rOuter and r = rOuter -
 pos_change_at(rOuter). This last trick avoids the "rings" that would appear for larger values of B (b/c a relatively
 large fraction of the dots are recycled every update frame).


 REVISION HISTORY:
 15apr2019-- Began development. Instead of being the abstract base class for RMVideo targets, with a separate concrete
 class for each type, CRMVTarget now handles the implementation of all target types. Furthermore, OpenGL code is 
 isolated within the singleton render manager, CRMVRenderer, and the draw() method calls CRMVRenderer methods to render
 the target to the current OpenGL backbuffer.
 29apr2019-- Implementing a memory buffer pool for the backing storage required for RMV_RANDOMDOTS and _FLOWFIELD. 
 30apr2019-- Modified to use texture pool managed by CRMVRenderer. Also, maintain reference to the target renderer
 internally -- the reference is provided via initialize().
 06may2019-- Modified to implement new "flicker" feature for all target types. Whenever the target "on" flag is set,
 the target can flicker IAW set ON and OFF durations, with an initial delay before the first ON flicker. Target motion
 continues as usual, regardless the flicker state. Furthermore, the flicker state resets each time the target's "on/off"
 flag is toggled "on".
 04jun2019-- Bug fix in initTargetColors(): Failed to compute Lmin correctly for G,B components for RMV_RANDOMDOTS in
 the two-color contrast mode.
 04jun2019-- Revised implementation of aperture for RMV_RANDOMDOTS. Instead of using alpha mask, per-dot alpha is 
 computed every frame and delivered to the fragment shader via vertex attribute "Tx". The monolithic shader was 
 modified to handle this special case.
 18sep2019-- Refactor: CVidBuffer (accessed through CRMVRenderer) implements a scheme for opening video streams that
 are then buffered on a background thread to improve playback performance, particularly for movies that have a larger
 frame size. All LIBAV calls are now isolated in CVidBuffer.
 23sep2019-- Prior to the introduction of CVidBuffer, updateMovie() for RMV_MOVIE would block waiting until the next
 frame was read in. We implement the same block by waiting until CVidBuffer::getCurrentFrameData() returns non-NULL.
 However, if the video streaming failed, it will always return NULL. So we need to detect this condition, which must
 be considered fatal for the ongoing animation sequence. To communicate this to CRMVRenderer, updateMotion() now 
 returns FALSE if a fatal error has occurred.
 24sep2019-- To ensure that the texture object backing an RMV_IMAGE target is truly allocated and loaded onboard the
 GPU, we actually "draw" the image in the initialize() method. This is because testing has shown that the actual 
 allocation and loading of the texture object may be delayed by the OpenGL driver until the texture is actually used.
 Since allocation may take longer for a large texture (eg. for a 2560x1440 image), the delay may be significant
 enough that it causes a frame drop if it happens in the middle of an RMVideo animation sequence. By doing a draw
 in the initialize() method, we force the driver to allocate the texture object at that time, BEFORE the animation
 starts. Since drawing happens on the backbuffer, and since CRMVRenderer clears the backbuffer after loading all 
 targets, nothing appears onscreen.
 30sep2019-- Implemented a round-robin scheme using pixel buffer objects to upload frame data to the texture for the
 RMV_MOVIE implementation, rather than uploading directly from a normal CPU-side array. This brought a significant
 performance improvement, so that it is now feasible to playback a 1024x768 video at 144Hz.
 02oct2019-- Testing suggested that we're hitting the pixel transfer bottleneck for videos larger than 1024x768.
 Tried a new scheme with 3 PBOs and 3 texture objects. In each frame period, we draw tex N (which was uploaded 
 previously via PBO N), upload to tex N+1 via PBO N+1, and copy frame N+2 to PBO N+2. This scheme did not work at
 all; in fact, performance was poorer.
 17oct2019-- Implemented a pixel buffer object pool to see if reusing PBOs would improve performance. Test results
 were not conclusive. Commented out the PBO pool implementation, in case we want to revisit it at a later date.
 22oct2019-- Tried glMapBufferRange(GL_MAP_WRITE_BIT|GL_MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT). In Chapter 28 of "OpenGL Insights", 
 testing suggested that -- with NVidia GPUs -- using triple buffering within a single buffer object (3x size needed) 
 via glMapBufferRange() and handling synch manually offered better performance over other techniques. I tried the 
 technique and it did NOT improve performance.
 23oct2019-- Tried similar technique but using immutable storage via glBufferStorage(), a persistently mapped 
 buffer via GL_MAP_WRITE_BIT|GL_MAP_PERSISTENT_BIT|GL_MAP_COHERENT_BIT. Requires OpenGL 4.4 or relevant extension.
 DID NOT IMPROVE PERFORMANCE. Then combined this technique with a PBO pool; performance was marginally worse.
 Returned to the round-robin scheme with 3 PBOs.
 23oct2019-- Tried round-robin queue of 3 PBOs with a pair of identical textures that were alternately uploaded and
 drawn during each refresh period. DID NOT IMPROVE PERFORMANCE.
 24oct2019-- Decided to stick with the round-robin queue of 3 PBOs for the RMV_MOVIE implementation, with no PBO pool
 (since it did not improve performance). Removed the code that implemented the PBO pool.
 28oct2019-- Tried a single massive persistently mapped PBO that was partitioned into 3-PBO queues for each movie
 target (until fixed capacity reached). DID NOT IMPROVE PERFORMANCE.
 04nov2019-- Wrapped up performance tweaking and testing. Releasing changes as RMVideo 10c.

/**
 Create a pool of memory buffers used to store per-dot vertex attributes, lifetimes and noise factors for the 
 random-dot target types RMV_RANDOMDOTS and RMV_FLOWFIELD.

 Unlike all of the other RMVideo target types, the random-dot targets can have a significant number of vertices -- one
 per dot --, and the vertex attributes of each dot typically change on a frame-by-frame basis. As a result, these 
 targets require a large CPU-side buffer to store the vertex attributes. Furthermore, any RMV_RANDOMDOTS target with 
 the "finite dot life" and "noise" features require additional buffers to track each dot's current lifetime and noise
 factor. Allocating these buffers each time a target is created (and deallocating them when the target is deleted) is
 inefficient and may be a performance drag when running trials involving random-dot targets in rapid succession. 

 Instead, CRMVTarget implements a static memory buffer pool so that previously allocated buffers can be reused.

 This method should be called during startup to create the initial buffer pool. It will preallocate 10 buffers, each
 of which can handle the vertex attributes for a random-dot target with the maximum allowed number of dots in Maestro.

/**
 Initialize RMVideo target IAW the target definition specified. Validate target definition, allocate any additional 
 OpenGL resources required to render the target, position target at the origin, and turn it off initially.

 Target initialization can include GL calls that draw on the current backbuffer. As long as the backbuffer is not
 swapped before it is cleared, there will be no visible effect onscreen. In fact, CRMVRenderer::loadTargets() will 
 call glFinish() after loading and initializing all targets in the animated target list; it then redraws the idle
 background to ensure the backbuffer is in the expected state.

 Testing with large RMV_IMAGE targets has demonstrated that the driver may delay the allocation and loading operation 
 until the texture object is actually used; if this happens in the middle of an ongoing animation sequence (if the 
 target turns "ON" at some t>0), the time to allocate and load the texture object may result in a duplicate frame 
 error. To avoid this, we force texture allocation by calling draw() after completing target initialization.

/**
 Helper method for updateMotion(): Handles motion update tasks specific to RMV_GRATING and RMV_PLAID targets.

 For single-grating targets, by design, RMVTGTVEC.hPat is the position change of the grating along its drift axis and
 RMVTGTVEC.vPat is ignored. HOWEVER, if RMV_F_ORIENTADJ flag is set, then (hPat,vPat) represents the vector position
 change of the grating target. The grating's per-frame orientation is its initial orientation (from the target def)
 offset by the vector's direction. The grating's spatial phase is updated by calculating the projection of the pattern
 velocity vector onto the vector perpendicular to the per-frame orientation. If hPat=vPat=0, the vector direction is
 undefined and its amplitude is zero. In this case, the grating's orientation and spatial phase in the previous display
 frame are carried over into the current frame.

 For plaid targets, the two grating components may move independently, or they may act together to form a single
 unified plaid pattern -- depending upon the state of the RMV_F_INDEPGRATS flag. In the former case, RMVTGTVEC.hPat is
 treated as the position change of grating #1 along its drift axis, while RMVTGTVEC.vPat is the position change of
 grating #2 along its drift axis. In the latter case, (hPat,vPat) represents the vector position change of the plaid
 pattern as a whole; we must compute the position drift for each grating that will achieve this net change position of
 the plaid. If the RMV_F_ORIENTADJ flag is set (in which case RMV_F_INDEPGRATS is unset, as these features are
 incompatible!), then the component gratings' orientations are adjusted on a per-frame basis as described above for the
 single-grating case.

 Position drift of each grating is converted into a shift in the grating's spatial phase.

/**
 Render the target IAW its current state. If the target is not ON, then nothing is rendered.

 The RMVideo render manager, CRMVRenderer, uses a single shader program for all rendering. A single texture unit is 
 always bound to texture unit 0, with blending enabled with glBlendFunc(src_alpha, 1-src_alpha) -- although for some
 targets the texture is the trivial 4x4 "no-op" alpha=1 mask. A single vertex array is shared among all participating
 targets. This array is allocated at startup. Most targets use one of four simple, unchanging primitives that are 
 defined in the array at startup. Only the dot targets (RMV_RANDOMDOTS and _FLOWFIELD) must stream per-dot vertex 
 attributes to the array prior to rendering. During target initialization, a dot target reserves a contiguous segment
 of the array for its exclusive use. Then, during the "update motion" phase of a display frame, the per-dot vertex 
 attributes are recalculated for that frame and uploaded to that reserved segment. All that remains to do in the "draw"
 phase is to render the vertices in that segment IAW the target's properties.

 The idea behind this rendering approach is to minimize the number of OpenGL state changes that have to take place
 during an animation sequence. The only OpenGL state that changes from target to target are the values of certain
 uniform variables passed to the shader program, the ID of the bound texture object, and the kind of primitive(s) 
 rendered.

/**
 Helper method for initialize(): Initialize any additional state information relevant to the target type implemented,
 and allocate any additional OpenGL resources required to render the target.

 1) Alpha mask texture. RMV_SPOT, _GRATING, _PLAID and _RANDOMDOTS all support a non-rectangular aperture and a 2D
 Gaussian blur. Both aperture and blur are implemented by an alpha mask texture object generated here -- but NOT for
 the RMV_RANDOMDOTS target.

 For RMV_RANDOMDOTS, each dot is either inside or outside the aperture, regardless the dot size; it cannot be partly
 obscured at the aperture boundary). The per-dot alpha component is computed every frame based on the dot's location,
 which typically changes during an animation. That alpha component is transmitted to the fragment shader via the
 vertex attribute "Tx", the X-coordinate of the dot's texel location in the applied texture -- which will be the
 default "alpha=1" mask. In the fragment shader, the result of the texturing operation is ignored, and the fragment
 alpha is set to the value of Tx. Note that, if the aperture is RMV_RECT and there's no Gaussian window, then all
 dots have alpha = 1 always.

 2) RMV_IMAGE. An RGBA texture object is allocated and loaded with the image data here.

 3) RMV_MOVIE. The video source file is opened and all of the infrastructure for streaming video frames from the file
 is prepared. An RGB texture object is also allocated here to hold each movie frame image streamed from the file.
 Video streaming is handled by a utility class, CVidBuffer, on a background thread. When the video stream is opened
 here, a stream ID is assigned. CRMVTarget uses that ID to retrieve frames during playback. In addition, to get 
 better performance uploading frame data to the texture object, we employ a round-robin queue of pixel buffer objects.
 During frame N, we copy pixel data for frame N+1 to a PBO and while the data from frame N is being uploaded from 
 another PBO to the texture object.

 4) Segment of shared vertex array in which target's vertices are stored. For all except the two random-dot target
 types, the target primitive is extremely simple: a single quad, a line segment, or a single point. CRMVRenderer 
 allocates a shared vertex array and backing buffer at startup that is large enough to hold 50K vertices. It stores 
 these fixed target primitives at the beginning of the array. The array segment defining a particular fixed primitive 
 is identified by a start index and vertex count, which are exposed as public constants of CRMVRenderer. Each vertex 
 has two attributes -- normalized location (x,y) and corresponding texel location (Tx, Ty) -- as required by the 
 monolithic OpenGL shader program that handles all rendering in RMVideo. The attributes of the fixed primitives never
 change, so they can be shared by multiple targets during an animation sequence. A target-specific transform converts
 each normalized vertex location to its rendered location in the vertex shader.

 5) For RMV_RANDOMDOTS and RMV_FLOWFIELD, the target must query CRMVRenderer for a dedicated segment (start index and
 count) of the shared vertex array in which the individual dot attributes are stored. Furthermore, internal arrays
 are allocated to store per-dot vertex attributes (and, for RMV_RANDOMDOTS, possibly per-dot lifetimes and noise 
 factors). In updateMotion(), the vertex attributes are updated every frame and uploaded to the dedicated segment in
 the shared vertex array.

 6) For RMV_RANDOMDOTS and RMV_FLOWFIELD, the pseudo random number generator used to randomize dot locations is 
 created and initialized here. Also, a second RNG is prepared for any RMV_RANDOMDOTS target using the dot speed or
 direction noise feature.

 7) For RMV_GRATING and RMV_PLAID, the spatial period of each component grating is calculated. If the spatial period
 is too small, the target cannot be rendered and this method fails with an appropriate error message.

 @return True if resource allocation was successful; false otherwise. In the event of an error, a brief error
 message is written to the console via fprintf(stderr, ...).

 Dots are randomized within the rectangle that bounds the target aperture. Thus, except for the rectangular aperture,
 some dots will be positioned outside the aperture. Of course, this means that the number of dots actually visible at
 any time will be less than the defined number of dots for all apertures except the rectangular one.

 Since the flow field is a circular annulus, the method randomly chooses an angle, then a radial value lying between
 the field's inner and outer radii. From these polar coordinates, calculation of the x,y coords is straightforward.
