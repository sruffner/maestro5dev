/** rmvrenderer.cpp ===================================================================================================
 Implementation of class CRMVRenderer, which handles all OpenGL rendering in RMVideo

 CRMVRenderer was the product of a complete rethinking of how RMVideo renders. Prior to RMVideo V10, OpenGL rendering
 was handled by CRMVDisplay and a bunch of independent implementations of the abstract CRMVTarget class -- one class
 for each RMVideo target type. One of the problems with this design is that, because each target object "knows"
 nothing of the current OGL state, each target does its own thing. The situation is worse in OGL3.3 because every
 target uses a shader and has a vertex array and possibly a texture. Alternatively, we could isolate all rendering
 (and all OpenGL calls) to a monolithic renderer object, CRMVRenderer. It manages the animated target list and controls
 the runtime loop during an animiation sequence. Each target object (now CRMVTarget is a concrete class that implements
 all target types) requests OpenGL sources (vertex array space, texture object) from CRMVRenderer, and relies on 
 CRMVRenderer methods to issue the OpenGL commands that render the target IAW its current state.
 
 With a monolithic renderer it was easier to do optimizations like these:

 ==> Use a single shader program. The program is compiled, loaded, and made active at startup and never changes --
 so no shader switching happens. A shader program is required to conform to OpenGL3.3 (prior versions of RMVideo used
 legacy "immediate mode" functions. The vertex and fragment shaders for RMVideo are very simple -- simple enough that
 the GLSL code could be maintained in static string constants rather than separate source files. See VERTEXSHADERSRC
 and FRAGMENTSHADERSRC.

 ==> Some RMVideo targets need one texture (image, movie, alpha mask for some targets), others don't. For targets that
 don't, we can assign a small alpha=1 texture. (a) This makes the texture application in the single fragment shader
 simpler. (b) Since we only use texture unit 0, we can set the uniform that identifies this unit at application
 startup and never change it. (c) We can enable GL_TEXTURE2D and GL_BLEND at app startup and leave them enabled always,
 with the standard blend function (src_alpha, 1-src_alpha). We still have to bind a texture object to texture unit 0
 for each target drawn, but if all of the targets use the default alpha=1 texture, we can bind that once and never
 change it again. 

 ==> Most of the RMVideo targets use a very small vertex array (two triangles forming a quad, one line segment, or
 even a single point). Only the RMV_FLOWFIELD and RMV_RANDOMDOTS targets have large vertex arrays for the individual
 dots. To avoid allocating/deallocating vertex arrays frequently, CRMVRenderer creates and binds a single large vertex
 array at application startup. The simple quad, line segment and point primitives are preloaded at the front of this
 array in normalized coordinates. They can be shared by any target that needs them; a target-specific transform 
 (passed as a uniform to the vertex shader) handles the transformation from normalized to screen coordinates. The 
 rest of the vertex array is reserved for storing the vertex attributes for any flowfield or random-dot patch targets,
 and each such object reserves a contiguous portion of the array during target initialization. See the methods 
 reserveSharedVertexArraySegment() and uploadVertexData().

 ==> CRMVRenderer manages a texture memory pool to avoid excessive allocation and reallocation of GPU-side texture
 objects for images, movie frames, and alpha masks.

PERFORMANCE NOTE: As of May 2019, this OpenGL3.3 implementation of RMVideo (V10) does not perform quite as well as the
original OpenGL1.1 implementation (RMVideo V9). This is based on running trials that involve multiple fullscreen 
plaids, gratings, or spots on a 2560x1440 monitor at 144Hz (Dell S2417DG). The results show that this implementation
exhibits many more frame drops on the test trials involving plaid and grating targets, and this is likely because I
chose to leave the grating calculations in the fragment shader instead of using the multi-texturing approach in the
OpenGL1.1 implementation. In the future I many update this implementation to also use textures for the gratings, but
at this point it seems overkill. First, practical experiments are unlikely to animate multiple fullscreen grating or
plaid targets in the same trial. Second, it may be a while yet before labs start using monitor rates of 100Hz or
greater.

 Support for streaming videos on a background thread: Testing demonstrated that RMVideo could not handle streaming
 a 1024x768 video even if the refresh rate was as low as 85Hz. Trials involving such large movie targets would fail
 frequently on a duplicate frame error. In an effort to address this problem, we've introduced a new singleton
 CVidBuffer, as a public member of CRMVRenderer. CVidBuffer supports buffering up to 5 different video streams on a 
 background thread. On a multi-core system, the buffering thread is configured to run on one CPU from which RMVideo's
 main thread of execution is excluded. This, combined with a 10-frame in-memory queue for each open video stream,
 will hopefully increase the frame size of videos that RMVideo can present reliably. The video streamer object is
 public so that CRMTarget objects can conveniently access it during target initialization and motion updates.

 REVISION HISTORY:
 11apr2019-- Began development.
 24apr2019-- Completed development and tested. Performance worse than previous iteration with multiple target classes,
 a single shader, and "quick-n-dirty" implementations of a texture memory pool and a float buffer pool for the dot-
 patch target. Suggests that we need both the single shader and the memory pools for best performance. 
 29apr2019-- Implemented a float buffer pool in CRMVTarget, and implemented a texture object pool -- for alpha mask,
 RGBA image, and RGB movie frame textures -- in this class.
 01may2019-- Performance worsened with the texture pool. The original texture pool implementation was a hack that 
 preallocated 10 512x512 alpha mask textures and used them, as is, for all alpha masks regardless the actual size
 required. Trying to improve the new texture implementation to be more flexible than that, yet reduce the frequency of
 alpha mask texture re-allocations.
 06may2019-- Tweeked RMV_GRATING/PLAID implementation in fragment shader, eliminating several calculations that were
 the same for all target fragments. Changed some of the grating-related uniforms in rmvtarget.fs and updated the
 method updateGratingUniforms() accordingly.
 08may2019-- Since the vertex and fragment shader code in rmvtarget.vs/.fs is relatively simple, I decided to put
 the code in static strings defined here -- so that users can't break RMVideo by accidentally deleting the shader
 source files.
 04jun2019-- Modified fragment shader, replacing "isImage" uniform with "special": =1 for RMV_IMAGE and RMV_MOVIE;
 =2 for RMV_RANDOMDOTS, and =0 otherwise. For RMV_RANDOMDOTS, per-dot alpha is stored in texel coordinate Tx and
 alpha mask is not used. Fragment shader code adjusted accordingly.
 18sep2019-- Integrating helper class CVidBuffer, which manages a background thread that buffers video streams for 
 RMV_MOVIE targets during an animation sequence. The CVidBuffer member object is publicly accessible so that 
 RMV_MOVIE targets can access it directly.
 23sep2019-- CRMVTarget::updateMotion() now returns a boolean. If false, then a fatal error has occurred. 
 CRMVRenderer::animate() modified accordingly.
 24sep2019-- Technical change in loadTargets(). Target objects may draw on current backbuffer during initializations,
 primarily to ensure requested GL resources (like texture objects) are allocated immediately on the GPU, rather than
 in the middle of an animation sequence. After target loading, a glFinish() ensures any queued GL commands are 
 executed.
 27jan2020-- Modified measureFramePeriod() to use supplied nominal rate to compute an initial estimate of the
 refresh period, which is then used to detect any skipped frames during the 500-frame measurement period. If a 
 nominal rate is not supplied, it instead calculates an initial estimate over 50 frames prior to commencing the
 500-frame measurement.

 Vertex shader source code for RMVideo (originally in source file rmvtarget.vs).

 All RMVideo target implementations pass the 2D vertex location and the corresponding 2D texture coordinates to this 
 vertex shader via vertex array. Target RGB color and transform are supplied via uniforms. The shader transforms the 
 vertex location to normalized space. It passes on the transformed vertex, the texture coordinates, and the target
 color to the fragment shader.
 
 NOTES: (1) For the RMV_RANDOMDOTS target's "two-color constrast mode", one half the dots are rendered in one color, 
 and the other half in the second color. So the dot patch is rendered in two parts in that mode. (2) Targets which 
 don't really need a texture are bound to a tiny alpha texture with alpha=1.0 for all texels.

/**
 Fragment shader source code for RMVideo (originally in source file rmvtarget.fs).

 RMV_BAR, RMV_SPOT, RMV_GRATING, RMV_PLAID: Target window maps to a single quad (vertices define two component
 triangles). Aperture shape and Gaussian blur are implemented by the alpha mask texture, which is pre-loaded before
 animation begins. If no blur and rectangular aperture, this texture is 4x4 with alpha = 1.0 for all texels. For 
 grating and plaid targets, a number of uniforms contain the parameters for the per-fragment grating
 calculations.

 RMV_MOVIE, RMV_IMAGE: Target window is a single quad, as above. Source texture is an RGBA texture containing the
 full image, or an RGB texture holding the video frame. The shader simply maps the texture onto the quad.

 RMV_POINT, RMV_FLOWFIELD, RMV_RANDOMDOTS: Vertices define individual dot locations (GL_POINTS) and are updated
 per-frame (for RMV_FLOWFIELD and _RANDOMDOTS, vertices are calculated on CPU side and then transformed in the
 vertex shader; for RMV_POINT, a fixed vertex at the origin is tranformed in the vertex shader). The fragment 
 color is found by combining the RGB color from the vertex shader with the alpha component from the alpha mask
 texture. For POINT and FLOWFIELD, this texture is always the 4x4 mask with alpha = 1.0 for all texels. For RANDOMDOTS,
 the alpha mask texture is NOT USED. Instead, each dot's alpha component is calculated every frame and delivered
 via the vertex attribute "Tx" representing the X-coordinate of the dot's corresponding texel location.

 All necessary information is passed via uniform variables. Note that, if a target implementation does not use a
 particular uniform, that variable will not be set by the client. For example, for the RMV_SPOT target, none of the
 uniforms related to the grating calcs apply.

 Create all OpenGL resources required to do all target rendering in RMVideo:

 1) Compile and load the single shader program that is used to do all rendering in RMVideo. The source code for the 
 shaders is defined in static strings VERTEXSHADERSRC and FRAGMENTSHADERSRC. Once loaded successfully, the shader 
 program is bound as the current program, since it never changes.
 2) Allocate buffer used to generate alpha mask textures and load them into GPU texture memory.
 3) Allocate the 50K vertex array/buffer that is used to transfer all vertex data (across all targets) to the vertex 
 shader during an RMVideo animation sequence. 
 4) Generate the 4x4 "alpha=1" default texture that is bound when rendering a target that does not need an alpha mask
 texture nor image texture.
 5) Create a reusable texture object pool that supplies alpha mask, RGBA image, or RGB movie frame textures for use
 by RMVideo targets, allocating new textures only when necessary. Initialize the pool with several alpha-mask textures,
 which are likely to be used most frequently.
 6) Allocate a memory pool for per-dot parameter storage required by the random-dot target types. This will avoid 
 frequent memory allocations/deallocations associated with those targets. See CRMVTarget::createBufferPool().

 This method must be called during RMVideo startup, and RMVideo should exit on failure. Error messages are written to
 the console. It also must be called each time RMVideo's fullscreen window is re-created -- which happens on any video
 mode switch.

/**
 Reserve a contiguous segment of the RMVideo's shared vertex array/buffer for streaming vertices to the OpenGL driver.

 In RMVideo, only the random-dot target types -- RMV_RANDOMDOTS and RMV_FLOWFIELD -- need to stream vertex data to the
 shader program on a frame-by-frame basis. All other targets use a very simple fixed primitive, either a quad, vertical
 line segment or single point. To avoid continually binding and unbinding vertex arrays during an animation sequence
 involving multiple targets of different types, our strategy is to allocate a single large vertex array/buffer that is
 shared among all targets animated.

 The fixed primitives are stored at the start of this shared array and their vertex attributes never change, so they
 can be used by multiple targets.

 A random-dot target, however, must reserve a contiguous segment within the shared array for its exclusive use. During
 an animation sequence, the target object will stream per-dot vertex attributes to this segment on a frame-by-frame
 basis by calling uploadVertexData().

 Call this method to reserve a segment within the shared vertex array. The array can support up to 50K vertices, which
 should be more than enough for any practical animation in RMVideo.

/**
 Utility method that prepares a single-component texture defining the translucency ("alpha") mask that implements the
 three non-rectangular RMVideo apertures (RMV_OVAL, _RECTANNU, and _OVALANNU) as well as a 2D Gaussian spatial blur.
 The alpha mask texture essentially overlays the target's bounding rectangle when the target is drawn. Since the mask 
 never changes, it can be generated before the target is animated and applied as a texture on each draw cycle.

 The method computes and loads the alpha mask into texture memory and returns the texture ID. The texture format is
 GL_RED because we only need one color component, and GL_ALPHA is considered obsolete. In the fragment shader, the
 texture is sampled and the R component of the RGBA sample is assigned to the alpha component of the fragment color,
 thus "applying" the alpha mask (of course, alpha blending must be enabled).
 
 If the aperture is RMV_RECT and there's no Gaussian blur, then the target does not require an alpha mask. In this
 case, the method does nothing and returns 0. [Because our monolithic shader always applies a texture, CRMVRenderer
 binds a 4x4 "no-op" alpha mask texture, which has alpha=1 at all texel locations, and hence has no effect when 
 applied with glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA).]

 To optimize texture memory use, CRMVRenderer maintains an OpenGL texture object pool. If the pool contains an already 
 allocated alpha mask texture object that meets or exceeds the required dimensions, that texture object will be 
 reused. Otherwise, a new alpha mask texture is allocated and added to the pool.

 When the texture is no longer needed, callers must release it back to the texture pool by calling releaseTexture().

 NOTE: We tried implementing the alpha mask in the fragment shader, but testing demonstrated that this approach was
 actually slower than using a pre-calculated alpha texture, as in the OGL 1.1 implementation of RMVideo. This makes 
 sense, since the alpha calculations in the shader would be done on every frame and for every fragment. The alpha 
 texture need only be calculated during target initialization and loaded into GPU memory; then, in the shader, the
 texture is simply sampled and that sample is applied to the fragment's alpha component -- no calculations needed.

 NOTE 2: We first tried the modern OpenGL "render to texture" approach to generate the alpha mask texture, but this
 did not work.

 NOTE 3: Initially, we did not restrict the dimensions of the texture, nor require they be powers of 2. However, we
 found that the OGL 1.1 implementation was superior, possibly because that implementation enforces power-of-2 texture
 dimensions not to exceed 512. Decided to do the same here.

 @param aperture Aperture type. If not a supported type, RMV_RECT is assumed.

 be nonzero if aperture is RMV_RECTANNU or _OVALANNU.
 @param sigX,sigY The horizontal and vertical standard deviations of the 2D Gaussian blur applied to the target window.
 If both are zero, no blur is applied.
 @return If successful, the texture object's assigned OpenGL ID; else, 0. In the event of failure, a brief error 
 description is logged to the console window. Note that 0 is also returned if the aperture is RMV_RECT and 
 sigX=sigY=0 -- since no alpha mask is needed in this case.

 During the measurement, it is assumed that the fullscreen window is displayed. The background color is toggled between

 less than 80Hz or so. If this is not the case, then something is amiss! (eg, "tearing artifact" if VSync not enabled)

 Convert rectangular dimension WxH from pixels to RMVideo's drawing units, i.e., visual degrees subtended at eye.

 This conversion is important to handle rendering of the RMV_IMAGE and _MOVIE targets. Knowing the dimensions of the
 image and movie frame in pixels, we need to use the display geometry to convert them to visual degrees. The 
 calculation is complicated by two different aspect ratios: the screen aspect ratio (screen W in pixels / screen H 
 in pixels), and the "world aspect ratio" computed in visual degrees (screen W in deg / screen H in deg). These are
 generally not the same. To ensure that an NxN-pixel image looks "square" when displayed, I had to experiment to 
 find an approach that seemed to work consistently:
    ImageW_deg = ImageW_pix * ScreenDegPerPix_H;
    ImageW_deg *= screenAR / worldAR;
    ImageH_deg = ImageH_pix * ScreenDegPerPix_V;
 Only the image width is compensated for the aspect ratios. Of course, an NxN image will still look stretched if the
 display geometry is not accurate!!! For example, if you specify screen geometry (W and H in mm) such that the world
 aspect ratio is 4:3 when in reality it is 16:9, a square image (or a square RMV_SPOT target) will appear stretched
 horizontally by 16:9 / 4:3 = 1.333 : 1.

 Another way to compensate for aspect ratio is to adjust the projection matrix and use glOrtho(), but this messes up 
 all other target types that are dimensioned in visual degrees from the beginning.

 Load the participating target list for an animation sequence in response to Maestro's "load targets" command. The
 method queries RMVideo's CRMVIo communication link for the number of targets to be animated and their definitions.
 If unable to create one or more of the targets, the target list is cleared and the method fails.

 During initialization, the target objects may draw on the current backbuffer in order to force the OpenGL driver
 to execute certain GL operations that might otherwise be postponed until the GL resource is actually used. An 
 example is texture objects. GL calls to allocate and load a texture object in GPU memory may be postponed by the
 driver until the texture object is actually needed. But texture allocation can be time-consuming, so we do NOT 
 want that to happen during an animation sequence.

 After all targets are initialized, the method calls redrawIdleBackground() to ensure that any "queued" GL operations 
 are executed. This will effectively clear the backbuffer, so any "drawing" done during target inits will be erased,
 and the backbuffer is returned to a known state.

/**
 The runtime loop during an animation sequence: Renders RMVideo targets in response to per-frame updates from Maestro.

 After sending the relevant target definitions to RMVideo via the RMV_CMD_LOADTARGETS command, Maestro issues the
 RMV_CMD_STARTANIMATE command to start a frame-by-frame animation sequence. Upon receiving this command, RMVideo enters
 the "animate" state, which is managed entirely in this function. It retrieves the first set of target motion records 
 that come with the _STARTANIMATE command; these define changes in target state at the very beginning of the animation 
 sequence ("t=0"). Using this information, it renders the first display frame on the backbuffer. It then swaps buffers 
 and sends the RMV_SIG_ANIMATEMSG signal to Maestro. W2147483647ith VSync on, the execution thread stalls in the glFinish() call 
 after the buffer swap -- the driver waits for the vertical blanking interval to perform the swap. Thus, this signal is
 sent near the very beginning of the first display frame of the animation sequence -- "t=0". Since Maestro waits for 
 that signal, this scheme permits a *rough* but not perfect synchonization of the RMVideo and Maestro timelines. There
 is uncertainty due to Linux scheduler latency in returning from the wait in glFinish(), as well as the time it takes
 to send the ANIMATEMSG signal to Maestro and for Maestro to respond accordingly. [Because the synchronization cannot
 be exact, we introduced the sync spot flash feature so that researchers can use a photodiode to generate an external
 signal timestamped by Maestro.]

 RMVideo then retrieves the target motion records for the second display frame, which are also sent with the
 STARTANIMATE command. It immediately begins rendering the second display frame on the back buffer. Once the first
 display frame ends, it expects an RMV_CMD_UPDATEFRAME command to be already pending; this will contain the target 
 motion records for the third display frame. The animation sequence proceeds in this manner until Maestro sends 
 RMV_CMD_STOPANIMATE, at which point RMVideo will clear the screen, empty the target list, and return to the idle 
 state. Note that the only valid commands in the "animate" state are UPDATEFRAME and STOPANIMATE (STARTANIMATE is 
 detected in idle mode and processed upon entering animate mode).

 A key design requirement for RMVideo is that it detect duplicate frames, which may occur for two seperate reasons:
 (1) when it takes longer than a refresh period to render a single frame; or (2) when it does not receive the target
 motion update record for frame N by the start of frame N-1. In case (1), an RMV_SIG_ANIMATEMSG is sent with the
 payload [N,X], where N = # elapsed frames in the animation, and X>0 is the number of consecutive duplicate frames
 resulting from the rendering delay (the delay could last several refresh periods). The sequence of skipped frames 
 will have started at frame N-X. In case (2), RMV_SIG_ANIMATEMSG is sent with the payload [N,0]; in this case, frame 
 N+1 will be a duplicate of frame N.

 Finally, RMV_SIG_ANIMATEMSG is sent once per second in the animate state to notify Maestro of the "current" elapsed
 time on the RMVideo side. Here the payload is a single integer N, the # of frames elapsed since the animation sequence
 began. Maestro uses this information to verify that it is staying in sync with RMVideo and not getting too far ahead,
 in which case UPDATEFRAME commands build up in the receive buffer on the RMVideo side. (If Maestro falls behind,
 RMVideo will start missing target updates and send RMV_SIG_ANIMATE[N,0].)

 17jan-11feb2019: Since its inception, RMVideo exhibited a tearing artifact at the top of the screen because it 
 required that VSync be turned off. It tried to perform the swap during the vertical blanking interval by "busy 
 waiting" for the frame counter to increment, repeatedly calling glXGetVideoSync(), then immediately swapping buffers 
 once the counter had incremented. But this approach does not work perfectly, so the tearing artifact was evident at 
 the top of the screen. During testing and development of the OGL 3.3 implementation of RMVideo with a GTX1060 and Dell
 S2417DG display at 2560x1440@144Hz, we tried various strategies to address this problem and enhance performance. In
 the process, we discovered that CElapsedTime used the wrong clock source, resulting in a slight underestimation of the
 monitor's refresh period. We also discovered that RMVideo's execution thread sometimes stalled in glXGetVideoSync(),
 probably because the driver was busy or could not get immediate access to the vertical retrace counter.

 After a lot of testing and trying out various schemes, we decided on a new design strategy for the animation loop. We
 require that VSync be enabled, and rely on the fact that a glFinish() call after glXSwapBuffers() will stall until 
 the next vertical blanking interval, when the swap actually occurs. This stall synchronizes the CPU with the GPU and
 thus limits performance, but we actually WANT to ensure that we render exactly one new frame per refresh. To detect
 a duplicate frame caused by a rendering delay, we rely on our estimate of the refresh period P and compare the actual 
 elapsed time T to the expected elapsed time N*P. If T-N*P ~ P or greater, then a frame skip has occurred!

 Finally, we found that, because our estimate of the refresh period is not perfect, abs(T-N*P) would sometimes grow 
 over the course of a trial. If it was inaccurate enough, this could result in detecting a skipped frame when, in 
 fact, none had occurred. To address this issue, we now recalculate the refresh period as needed over the course of the
 animation sequence.

@return 1 if returning to idle state, 0 if ending command session because RMV_CMD_SHUTTINGDN was received or because the 
RMVideo-Maestro IO link failed, -1 if exiting RMVideo because RMV_CMD_EXIT was received.

 Update the uniform variables in RMVideo's monolithic shader which typically apply to all RMVideo targets: vertex
 transform "xfm", "special" identifier, and number of gratings "nGrats". Each CRMVTarget object will invoke this method
 in its draw() call to update these uniforms IAW its own properties.

 The vertex transform prepared here scales, translates and rotates each 2D vertex to its corresponding location in
 normalized screen coordinates. Here are the operations applied:
 1) Most target types use one of the fixed primitives, in which the vertices are normalized so they can be used for 
 multiple targets. So the first operation is to scale IAW the target's bounding width and height so that the vertices
 are now in logical coordinates (visual deg subtended at eye) WRT the target center.
 2) If the target needs to be rotated about the center, that rotation is applied next.
 3) Next, by translating to the target's center point, the vertex will be in visual deg WRT origin at screen center.
 4) Finally, to get normalized screen coordinates, we scale by (2.0/wDeg, 2.0/hDeg, 1.0), where wDeg and hDeg are the
 screen extents in visual deg.

 @param x,y [in] Target center coordinates in visual degrees subtended at eye, where (0,0) is the screen center.

 Bind the specified texture object to texture unit 0.

 All targets rendered in RMVideo use a texture bound to texture unit 0. For image and movie targets, the texture object
 contains the image or movie frame to be rendered onto the target quad. For targets with a non-trivial aperture, the
 texture object defines an alpha texture that, via blending, implements the desired aperture. For all other targets,
 no texture is really needed, but we assign a 4x4 "alpha=1" texture so that we can use a single shader program for all
 rendering.

 Internally, we keep track of the texture object currently bound to texture unit 0 in order to minimize the number of
 times we have to bind/unbind a texture -- particularly during an animation sequence. This method does nothing if the
 texture ID specified matches the ID of the texture object currently bound.

/**
 Helper method for createResources(): Allocates the vertex array and backing buffer that is shared among all targets
 currently being animated.

 For any RMVideo target, the vertex array stores two attributes per vertex: the 2D vertex location (x,y) in normalized
 space, and the corresponding 2D texel location (Tx, Ty) in normalized texture space. For most target types, only 6
 vertices are required, defining two triangles that form a quad. The RMV_POINT target has just a single vertex, and the
 zero-width RMV_BAR target needs two vertices defining a vertical line segment. Furthermore, these three primitives 
 (quad, point, line) are fixed -- the vertex attributes never change. Only the RMV_FLOWFIELD and RMV_RANDOMDOTS targets
 potentially require lots of vertices (one vertex per dot), and these vertices must be updated on a frame-by-frame
 basis (GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW option).

 To avoid frequent vertex array/buffer object allocations and deallocations, as well as the overhead of binding and
 unbinding vertex arrays, we preallocate a single large vertex array that is shared by all targets being animated. The
 array can handle up to 50K vertices, which is likely way more than will ever be used. Four fixed fixed primitives
 (point, line, quad, and an inverted quad for movie frame image textures) are stored at the beginning of the array. 
 Again, they never change and so can be assigned to multiple targets; the normalized vertex coordinates are transformed
 in a target-specific way in the vertex shader. Each flowfield or random-dot patch target are assigned their own 
 segment (start index, count) in the vertex array and vertex data is uploaded to that segment prior to each frame draw.

 NOTE: Generally it is not recommended that static vertex data be stored in the same buffer as dynamic data, but that
 is because techniques for optimizing the buffer updates often involve buffer orphaning and re-specification. However,
 RMVideo requires that frame N-1 be completely rendered on the backbuffer before starting work on frame N. That is,
 RMVideo explicitly synchronizes the GPU and CPU at the end of every frame. So we don't have to worry about an
 implicit synchronization happening during a buffer update.
