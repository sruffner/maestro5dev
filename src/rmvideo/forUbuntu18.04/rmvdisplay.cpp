/** rmvdisplay.cpp ====================================================================================================
 Implementation of CRMVDisplay, encapsulation of the RMVideo OpenGL-based display.

 CRMVDisplay is the "engine" for RMVideo. It sets up the fullscreen window and polls for and responds to commands 
 during a command session (either emulated via file or over the network with Maestro). 

 While CRMVDisplay manages all interactions with the OpenGL XWindows client (GLX), all OpenGL rendering is encapsulated
 in CRMVRenderer. CRMVRenderer draws the fullscreen background while in idle mode, manages the list of targets that
 participate in an animation sequence, and control the runtime loop during an animation sequence.

 Additional helper objects handles other important tasks in RMVideo: CRMVIoNet implements the Maestro/RMVideo
 communication protocol (see abstract class RMVIo for a description of the protocol), CRMVIoSim implements a simulated
 Maestro command stream stored in a text file, and CRMVMediaMgr manages the RMVideo media store (for RMV_IMAGE and
 RMV_MOVIE targets).

 As of version 9, RMVideo requires synchronization with the vertical blanking interval, which eliminates the 
 so-called tearing artifact. All prior releases required that VSync be turned off and used a relatively obscure 
 GLX extension, glXGetVideoSyncSGI(), to "busy-wait" on the blanking interval before performing a buffer swap. See
 discussion below on "SyncToVBlank".

 As of version 10, RMVideo conforms to the OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile. All prior releases only required OpenGL 1.1 and 
 relied on legacy "immediate mode" functionality for all rendering. Such functions are inefficient and considered 
 long obsolete, and one day may be removed altogether from the OpenGL standard (although they're still supported in
 NVidia's Linux drivers as of 2019). For additional details, see CRMVRenderer.

 ==> HISTORY on "SyncToVBlank" and the design of the animation loop.
 1) From 2009: On my machine (Linux Mandriva 10.1, XOrg 6.7, DRI, Matrox G550), vertical sync is off by default. In 
 this case, glXSwapBuffers() swaps ASAP, not during vertical retrace -- so tearing is always present. There are various
 GLX extensions out there that are supposed to turn on vertical sync, but I couldn't get anything to work. In the end,
 to get vertical sync and eliminate the tearing artifact, I employed the following hack: render frame; call glFinish()
 to ensure all commands have been executed; call extension glXGetVideoSyncSGI() repeatedly to detect when the video 
 sync counter increments; then call glXSwapBuffers() to perform the swap. Effectively, we're waiting for the vertical
 retrace in user mode! The hack worked ONLY because I am able to run in soft real-time mode via sched_setscheduler().
 One must have super-user privileges to run that function.
 2) Using glXGetVideoSyncSGI() is critical also because we use it do detect when RMVideo takes too long to render a
 frame, resulting in a "skipped frame"; or if it takes too long to receive motion data from Maestro for the next frame,
 resulting in a "duplicate frame".
 3) From May 2016: "SyncToVBlank" is an NVidia driver setting that is used to enable or disable vertical sync. It is 
 very important that SyncToVBlank be disabled for RMVideo to work correctly, given the way it counts frames using
 glXGetVideoSyncSGI(). If SyncToVBlank is ON, RMVideo will wait in glXSwapBuffers(), and that causes frame skip errors
 in Trial mode and worse behavior in Continuous mode. With 2016-era NVidia drivers and more up-to-date GLX libraries, 
 the GLX_EXT_swap_control extension now works, and I can use it to verify that SyncToVBlank is off, or turn it off if 
 it is on. See disableSyncToVBlank().
 4) Dec 2018: I need to investigate "SyncToVBlank" further. First of all, setting the swap interval to 0 with the
 glXSwapControlEXT() function does not appear to be the same as disabling SyncToVBlank. I ran a test in which the 
 fullscreen background color toggles between red and blue on every frame. With a fast enough refresh, the expected 
 perception is a purple screen that flashes somewhat (less so at higher refresh rate). If swap interval is 1, we tend
 to see red and blue flashing, and the test lasts twice as long -- because the color change is occurring every other
 refresh instead of every refresh. SO: we MUST set swap interval to 0. However, with SyncToVBlank=OFF, I would 
 occasionally see a blue band at the top of the mostly purple screen. This suggests that tearing is present, despite
 the fact that we're waiting for the video sync counter to increment before we call glXSwapBuffers(). When I turn on
 SyncToVBlank, the test is successful -- a purple screen for the duration, with no visible tearing. This test result
 suggests that tearing has been present all along, we just haven't noticed it. But based on my observations in 2016,
 I have to keep SyncToVBlank off to avoid frame skips. Yet there were no frame skips during the color toggle test.
 5) Jan-Feb 2019: Based on recommendations in an OpenGL forum, and after extensive testing of various approaches, I've
 settled on a new implementation of the animation loop:
    --> Ensure VSync is ON.
    --> In the animation loop: (1) render on backbuffer; (2) glXSwapBuffers(); (3) glFinish(); (4) detect a skipped
        frame when T-N*P ~= P or greater, where T = actual elapsed time, N = #frames elapsed, and P is our estimate of
        the monitor refresh period; (5) get next update from Maestro; (6) repeat.
 Testing showed that, with VSync ON, the driver waits in glFinish() [not glXSwapBuffers()!] for the vertical blanking 
 interval to begin. However, the driver may yield the CPU while waiting, stalling RMVideo's single thread. There is 
 latency in resuming the thread, and that can result in a frame skip if the latency is too large. Therefore, it is 
 vital that the Linux scheduler be configured to be as responsive as possible. Also note that we no longer use 
 glXGetVideoSyncSGI(); testing showed that the driver stalled in this function call, and the "resume latencies" tended 
 to be worse than with the above approach. Finally, the new implementation required a fix to CElapsedTime, which used
 the wrong clock source, CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID. It now uses CLOCK_MONOTONIC.
    NOTE that prior versions of RMVideo, with VSync off, exhibited tearing because of scheduler latencies in the calls
 to glXGetVideoSync(). Indeed, I was able to demonstrate this by toggling the background between red and blue on every
 frame. Usually the background was perceived as purple, but occasionally I would see a thin red or blue strip near the
 top of the screen. With VSync now ON, the tearing artifact is eliminated.
    Also, it is very likely that the prior versions of RMVideo failed to detect a skipped frame during the occasional
 trial because of scheduler latencies resulting in delays returning from glXGetVideoSync(). Also, our estimate of the
 refresh period was slightly off because we used the wrong clock source for CElapsedTime.
    The latest implementation avoids tearing altogether, provides a more accurate estimate of the monitor refresh
 period, and should be much more reliable in terms of detecting skipped frames.
    IMPORTANT: In Jan 2020, I found that glXGetVideoSync() is unreliable in Lubuntu 18.04 (kernel 5.3.0-26-generic).
I used it to get the video sync counter before and after a 550-frame epoch; the difference count was consistently
300 instead of 550 -- completely unacceptable!

 6) Feb-Mar 2019: Because the bug in CElapsedTime resulted in a slight underestimate of the refresh period, and 
 because Maestro relied on that estimate to time the delivery of UPDATEFRAME commands, Maestro would steadily "get
 ahead" of RMVideo over time, with UPDATEFRAME commands stacking up in the network receive buffer. This was not a
 problem in Trial mode because trials in practice are only 1-2 seconds long. However, RMVideo remains in the animate
 state for an indefinitely long time in Continuous mode (as long as there's an RMVideo target in the active list, even
 if that target is not on), and I observed an ever-growing lag when moving an active target around in CM as time went
 on. This led me to try a new approach to communications in the animate state, with RMVideo sending a request for a
 new target update as soon as it processes the previous UPDATEFRAME. THIS DID NOT WORK, and I had difficulty figuring
 out why, but it seemed to be a problem on the Maestro side. I decided to give up on that approach, hoping that the
 more accurate refresh period (after the CElapsedTime fix) will be sufficient to address the problem. I did make some
 changes to the communication protocol with Maestro to ensure the two apps "stay together". See animate() in 
 rmvrenderer.cpp.

 7) Jan 2020: While testing RMVideo in Lubuntu 18.04 (kernels 4.15, 5.0, 5.3) on a 4-core workstation, I determined 
 that running RMVideo's primary thread at maximum SCHED_FIFO priority was problematic. Multi-second "hangs" were
 observed in the NVidia driver's implementation of glFinish() with VSync enabled, and in network receive packet
 processing. Modified openDisplay() so that the primary thread remains at the default SCHED_OTHER priority, but
 requiring that it be eligible to run on at least 2 CPUs, preferably 4+. The hangs were eliminated. As of this change,
 RMVideo now REQUIRES a multi-processor workstation.

 REVISION HISTORY:
 25jul2005-- Began development; mostly just trying things out, making sure we can sync to vertical retrace, etc.
 17aug2005-- Began development of CRMVDisplay as the display and animation manager for RMVideo.
 31jan2006-- Mod IAW change in CRMVIo interface.  Now, RMVideo opens the fullscreen window only after a command
 session is initiated by CRMVIo::openSession().  The window is closed when the session is ended, and the RMVideo calls
 CRMVIo::openSession() to wait for the next session to start.
 02feb2006-- Mod IAW further changes in CRMVIo interface...
 29mar2006-- A "frame drop" signal (either RMV_SIG_DUPFRAME or _SKIPFRAME) is sent only ONCE during an animation
 sequence, instead of every time a frame drop is detected.  This change makes it easier to support how Maestro uses
 RMVideo in Continuous mode (frame updates are sent to RMVideo only sporadically instead of being streamed at the 
 monitor frame rate, as is the case in Trial mode).
 30mar2006-- Another refinement seeking to put a limit on the worst-case responsiveness of RMVideo. During an 
 animation, RMVideo draws each target in turn on the backbuffer, swaps buffers during the vertical sync, then checks
 for a new command. If it is animating a lot of complex targets, it could take much longer than one frame period to 
 draw a display frame on the backbuffer. While this situation is detected and reported via the RMV_SIG_SKIPFRAME 
 signal, we want to abort more gracefully from untenably slow animations. To do so, we've decided that RMVideo will 
 abort any animation sequence if a given frame has taken more than RMV_MAXFRAMELAG actual frame periods to render. 
 With this change, the worst case response time to a Maestro command is max(time to draw one target, RMV_MAXFRAMELAG 
 x framePer). There's currently no mechanism for "interrupting" RMVideo while it draws a single target.
 24apr2006-- Mod to support 24- or 16-bit RGB color, 24-bit preferred. Added new query command RMV_CMD_GETCOLORRES,
 by which RMVideo reports its color resolution in #bits.  The command is actually handled by the CRMVIo implementation,
 since color resolution is a static display property like frame period and display res.
 27apr2006-- Now require a minimum of 3 units in texture pipeline, to support best implementation (thus far) of plaid
 targets. This means RMVideo will no longer run on the Matrox G550, since available OpenGL driver only supports two 
 texture units.
 21jul2009-- Begun revisions to support reporting available video modes with a minimum horizontal resolution of 1024
 pixels and a minimum refresh of 75Hz. Requires the XRandR extension. If that extension is not available or not 
 supported on the machine, RMVideo will still run but it won't be possible to change the display resolution. Also, 
 24-bit color is now required.
 22jul2009-- Major changes. CRMVIo implementation no longer replies directly to any commands, so CRMVDisplay must
 reply to RMV_CMD_GETFRAMEPER and RMV_CMD_GETDISPRES. The animation-related commands provide motion vectors for all
 loaded targets, so CRMVIo::getMotionVector() no longer has the 'bNoChange' argument. Added support for listing video
 modes via RMV_CMD_GETALLVIDEOMODES and switching video mode via RMV_CMD_SETCURRVIDEOMODE.
 24aug2009-- Mod IAW same dtd changes to CRMVIoNet. Also added support for new command RMV_CMD_GETVERSION, _RESTART.
 May2016 -- Sundry changes while trying to build RMVideo with newer libraries for an up-to-date Linux kernel. The 
 major changes thus far: (1) Redesigned how video display modes are enumerated and how we switch modes. NVidia's
 support for RandR 1.0/1.1 protocols reports metamode IDs instead of refresh rates, which breaks the way we 
 originally did the enumeration. (2) Revamp of rmvmovie.*, which used deprecated and obsolete API from libavformat,
 libavcodec. (3) Modified to allow a minimum refresh of 60Hz, in case someone needs to use a LCD panel that doesn't 
 do better than 60Hz. (4) At start-up attempts to verify that SyncToVBlank is disabled; if enabled, tries to disable
 it using GLX_EXT_swap_control extension. Prints warning message if verification fails. See disableSyncToVBlank().
 23may2016-- Auto-update mechanism no longer supported. RMVideo must be updated manually. downloadExec() removed.
 05oct2016-- Updated to support new target class RMV_IMAGE, which displays a static image at any location on the
 screen. The notion of a "media store" replaces that of a "movie store", since it will contain both image and video
 files. CRMVMovieMgr was replaced by CRMVMediaMgr.
 24sep2018-- Started mods to implement vertical sync spot flash that may be triggered during an  animation sequence.
 A white square of fixed size is presented in the TL corner of screen with an optional dark margin below and to the 
 right of the spot....
 25sep2018-- Decided to get rid of the margin parameter for the sync flash: Just spot size and flash duration.
 26sep2018-- Revised rendering of sync flash spot to be analogous to the RMV_SPOT target.

 07dec2018-- Started major modifications to eliminate dependence on legacy "immediate-mode" OpenGL functions. 
 Conforming to OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile. Using vertex and fragment shaders for all rendering.
 17jan2019-- IMPORTANT change to eliminate tearing artifact: vertical sync is enabled, and animation loop changed
 so that we only check for frame skip after the buffer swap in glXSwapBuffers(). disableSyncToVBlank() replaced by
 enableSyncToVBlank().
 06feb2019-- Finalized re-design of the animation loop that relies on enabling vertical sync and calling glFinish()
 after glXSwapBuffers() to synchronize the CPU with the GPU. Fixed clock source for CElapsedTime, improving the 
 accuracy of refresh period measurement in estimateFramePeriod(). Now use elapsed time to detect a skipped frame; no
 longer use the extension glXGetVideoSyncSGI().
 26mar2019-- Mods to animate() to implement changes in communication protocol with RMVideo in animate mode. This is
 for RMVideo release version 9; commensurate changes in Maestro v4.0.5.
 08apr2019-- Making widespread changes in CRMVTarget and its subclasses to employ a single shader program for all 
 target rendering. Shader program switching can be a performance drag in OpenGL, and so far the OGL 3.3 implementation
 of RMVideo exhibits more frequent duplicate frames than OGL 1.1 implementation.
 22apr2019-- Added new singleton CRMVRenderer that handles almost all rendering tasks, except for the buffer swap,
 which involves GLX resources created by CRMVDisplay. Some functions that were handled by CRMVDisplay have been moved
 to CRMVRenderer -- particularly the loadTargets(), unloadTargets() and animate() commands. In addition, CRMVTarget is
 now a concrete class that handles all RMVideo target types, rather than having a separate class for each type.
 Updating CRMVDisplay IAW all of these changes.
 22apr2019-- Removing old code related to downloading a new RMVideo exec and restarting. The feature was removed some
 time ago (Maestro 3.2.1, RMVideo V6).
 09may2019-- Decided to adopt OpenGL3.3 Core Profile, along with the restructuring changes (single concrete CRMVTarget
 class; CRMVRenderer to encapsulate all OpenGL rendering), in the next RMVideo release: V10 with Maestro 4.1.0 -- plan
 to release in Jun 2019.
 27jan2020-- Modified to supply nominal refresh rate to CRMVRenderer::measurePeriod().
 27jan2020-- In Lubuntu 18.04 under 4.15, 5.0, and 5.3 kernels, running RMVideo's main thread at maximum SCHED_FIFO
 caused multi-second hangs in network receive packet processing and in NVidia driver's implementation of glFinish()
 with VSync enabled. While SCHED_FIFO worked in the 3.19 kernel under Lubuntu 14.04, it's clearly not an option going
 forward. On our 4-core development machine, it was not an issue to leave the primary thread at normal SCHED_OTHER
 priority. Modified openDisplay(), eliminating the change to SCHED_FIFO priority but requiring that the thread be
 eligible to run on more than one CPU.

/**
 Helper method for openDisplay(). It uses the RandR extension to query the available video modes on the system. If the
 current mode does not meet minimum requirements (1024x768@60Hz), then -- if possible -- switch to a mode that does.

 BACKGROUND: The 2009-era implementation used the RandR 1.0/1.1 protocols to query the available sizes via XRRSizes()
 and XRRRates(). However, later NVidia drivers, which implement the protocols, return "metamode IDs" instead of refresh
 rates via XRRRates(). The current implementation requires RandR 1.2 or better, and uses XRRGetScreenResources(), 
 XRRGetOutputInfo() and XRRGetCrtcInfo() to do the enumeration. Again, only modes 1024x768@60Hz or better are accepted.

 No action is taken if RandR 1.2 or better is not available. In this case, mode switching is disabled, and RMVideo 
 should abort during startup if the current video mode does not meet minimum requirements.

 CREDITS: See http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2w8ahe/changing_resolutions_for_fullscreen_in_x11_linux. We had
 to make some adjustments. In particular, we had to enumerate the video output ports to determine which one was 
 actually connected to a monitor.

//    important because the current video resolution can NEVER exceed screen size.
//
//    Let W,H be horizontal and vertical resolution in the current video mode and, by design, the current screen size.
//    Let W', H' be the resolution of the desired video mode. Then:
//       (1) If W' > W or H' > H, first set screen size to max(W,W') by max(H,H'). This new screen size is valid for
//    both the current and desired modes, which is required else the screen size change or mode switch would fail.
//       (2) Perform the mode switch. If that fails, restore the previous screen size.
//       (3) If W' < W or H' < H, set screen size to W',H' -- so no panning can happen in the new video mode.
