# simple script that launches RMVideo. Before launching, it turns ON vertical sync, screen saver, and display power
# management. It restores the screen saver and DPMS after RMVideo is killed via Ctrl-C (SIGINT); VSync is left ON.
# RMVideo traps SIGINT so that this script will continue execution when the RMVideo process exits. NOTE the full path
# to the RMVideo executable!
#
# 17jan2019: RMVideo redesigned to function properly with vertical sync on. In this launcher script we use 
# nvidia-settings to turn on SyncToVBlank. Since this is typically on anyway, we don't turn it off afterwards.
# 06feb2019: We altered Linux scheduler parameters to reduce the "resume execution latency" when the RMVideo thread
# stalls in glFinish() waiting for the vertical blanking interval. The default parameters are restored when 
# RMVideo exits. You may need to adjust these parameters for your particular Linux machine!
# 05mar2019: Further testing indicated that the changes in the Linux scheduler really didn't help much (and may
# even worsen RMVideo performance), so I've commented them out. 
# 05dec2019: To ensure DPMS disabled, need to set 0 timeouts for standby, suspend, and off modes.
# 13jan2020: Using nvidia-settings to force NVidia PowerMizerMode to "Prefer maximum performance" before launching 
# RMVideo, then restore it to Auto/Adaptive after RMVideo terminates. Dramatic performance improvement! Also removed
# the commented-out commands related to Linux scheduler parameters.
