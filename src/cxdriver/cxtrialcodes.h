// cxtrialcodes.h :  Format of trial codes defining the execution of a trial in MAESTRODRIVER
//
// AUTHOR:  saruffner, sglisberger, et al.
//
// DESCRIPTION:
// Before a trial begins, MAESTRO converts its definition into a sequence of "trial codes" that precisely define how
// each participating target's trajectory should evolve over the course of the trial.  These codes are downloaded to
// MAESTRODRIVER via the shared memory IPC interface.
//
// Each trial code is paired with a trial time at which the code takes effect, and may be followed by additional
// blocks providing the data needed to execute that code:
//    block 0: short code; --> trial code ID, as defined here
//             short time; --> trial time at which code takes effect, in # of ADC scans (= #runtime loop iterations)
//    block 1: short code; --> additional info; varies with each code -- see below
//             short time;
//       .....
//
// This file defines the code IDs for all trial codes currently supported by MAESTRODRIVER.  It indicates how many code
// blocks are associated with each ID and describes the contents of the additional code blocks (if any).
//
// REVISION HISTORY
// 06dec2001-- Created (adapted from cntrlxPC file tricodes.h).  Updated comments and removed obsolete codes.  Put the
//             TRIALCODE struct here.
// 20dec2001-- Added three new trial codes that are unique to CNTRLX/CXDRIVER:  CHECKRESPON, CHECKRESPOFF, FAILSAFE.
//             CntrlxUNIX handled the details of checking the subject's response to a staircase trial and of discarding
//             the trial if it stopped before the failsafe time.  In CNTRLX/CXDRIVER, however, these tasks will be the
//             responsibility of CXDRIVER -- hence the new trial codes.
// 20sep2002-- Added new sacc-trig'd optype, SPECIAL_FIX2.
// 23sep2002-- Changed trial code PULSESTIM to PSGM_TC, since PULSESTIM conflicted with the name of a struct.
// 18oct2002-- Introducing separate H & V fixation accuracy in existing trial code FIXACCURACY -- see comments below.
//          -- Dedicated previously unused field in FIXEYE1 trial code group to transmit "periodic reward enable" flag.
// 18dec2002-- Completely revamped usage of the TARGET_PERTURB trial code group to specify one of three kinds of
//             perturbation waveforms.
// 13jan2002-- NOTE:  The RANDOM_SEED trial code is no longer used...  The fixed seed value and the "auto/fixed seed"
//             flag are sent to CXDRIVER, and CXDRIVER itself handles seed generation.
// 23oct2003-- Added support for velocity stabilization (TARGET_HOPEN) on the H cmpt only, the V cmpt only, or both
//             H & V cmpts.  Bits[2..1] of the time1 field determine which components are enabled:  01 = H only, 10 =
//             V only; otherwise, both are enabled.  Added constants for masking out and checking these bits.
// 03nov2004-- Added special operation op code SPECIAL_DUALFIX.
// 25jan2005-- Changed special op code constant SPECIAL_DUALFIX to SPECIAL_SWITCHFIX.
//          -- Added NEW trial code MIDTRIALREW to define the parameters of any midtrial rewards delivered during the
//             trial.  It is always sent at the beginning of the trial and specifies the midtrial reward mode, the
//             reward interval for periodic mode, and the reward pulse length.
// 28jul2005-- Comments regarding changes to the TARGET_PERTURB code group to support a new perturbation type,
//             PERT_ISGAUSS, plus a seed value for the two random noise perturbations.  After commensurate changes in
//             CXDRIVER (as of v1.3.2), offline program should be able to reproduce any supported perturbation
//             waveform...
// 05dec2005-- Added special op code SPECIAL_RPDISTRO and new trial code RPDWINDOW in support of the new response
//             distribution-based reward contingency protocol, introduced in Maestro v1.4.
// 13mar2006-- Slight change in TARGET_HOPEN: tc[1].code now is set to the # of contiguous segments over which velocity
//             stabilization is enforced on fixation tgt #1.  It used to be set to the target ID, but that usage only
//             applied to Cntrlx.  In Maestro prior to this change, tc[1].code was ignored.  Effective in v1.5.0.
// 10apr2006-- Major mod to velocity stabilization feature -- we're generalizing it so that any trial target may be
//             stabilized during any trial segment.  TARGET_HOPEN trial code obsolete, replaced by new TARGET_VSTAB
//             code that is sent at the start of segment N for target M if target M's v-stab state is different from
//             what it was in segment N-1.  Effective in v2.0.0.
// 04jan2007-- Added special op codes SPECIAL_CHOOSEFIX1 and SPECIAL_CHOOSEFIX2. Effective in v2.0.5.
// 27feb2007-- Added trial codes to support specifying pattern acceleration cmpts H,V on a per-segment basis: 
//             INSIDE_HACC, INSIDE_VACC, INSIDE_HSLOACC, INSIDE_VSLOACC.
// 25apr2007-- Added comments to SPECIALOP trial code group to explain unique parsing when opType is SPECIAL_RPDISTRO.
// 01feb2011-- Added special op code SPECIAL_SEARCH. Effective in v2.6.5.
// 05sep2013-- Added constant MAXTRIALDUR = 32760. Even though we've removed most constraints to trial duration, one
// remains: the fact that the elapsed trial times in the trial codes are stored in ms as short integers!
// 24sep2018-- New feature: RMVideo vertical sync spot flash. PULSE_ON trial code group's 'time1' param, previously 
// unused, now is a flag: if time1 != 0, a square spot is presented in TL corner of RMVideo screen at the time in the
// 'time0' param. Note that the PULSE_ON code group is only sent at the start of each trial segment. Spot size, margin
// and duration are maintained in RMVideo display settings; the flash will be disabled if its size or duration is 0.
// As of Maestro v4.0.0 and RMVideo v8.
// 30apr2019-- Regression bug fix: Definition of VSTAB_MASK needed to be enclosed in parentheses! I had fixed this in
// Maestro v3.3.2, but I had used an older version of this code file when developing Maestro 4.0, so the bug got 
// reintroduced!
// 20may2019-- Added comment to REWARDLEN trial code: Pulse length set to 0 if reward pulse should be withheld. 
// Introduced random reward withholding variable ratio N/D in Maestro v4.1.0.

// This trial code is always sent after the SPECIALOP code for a trial that uses the "R/P Distro" operation and has at
// least one defined behavioral response window.  It sets the bounds for up to two such windows, where the behavioral
// response is eye velocity magnitude in deg/sec, averaged over the course of the "special segment".  The reward(s)
// delivered to the subject depend on the definition of these "reward windows".  If none are defined, the subject only
// gets the regular end-of-trial reward, using reward pulse #1 as usual.  If one or both windows are defined AND the
// measured response falls within one such window, then the subject has "passed the test" and gets two rewards:
// reward pulse #2 is delivered immediately after the special segment [NOT the same as the "atSegEnd" midtrial reward.
// Users are advised not to enable the "atSegEnd" midtrial reward for the "R/P Distro" special segment] and reward
// pulse #1 is delivered as the end-of-trial reward.  If the measured response falls outside the defined reward
// window(s), the subject has "failed the test" and gets only reward pulse #2 as an end-of-trial reward.  Of course,
// to properly motivate the subject, reward pulse #2 should be shorter than reward pulse #1.

// NOTE: If neither reward window is defined on the "R/P Distro" trial, then this trial code is NOT sent!
