// cxipc.h : The shared memory interface for IPC between MAESTRO (Windows) and its hardware driver MAESTRODRIVER (RTX).
//
// AUTHOR:  saruffner
//
// DESCRIPTION:
// Maestro is really two processes that work together: a Windows-based GUI "master" and an RTX64-based "driver" for
// hardware communication and "real-time" control of experimental protocols.
//
// "Maestro" refers to the Windows process that presents and manages the graphical user interface (GUI).  It is built
// upon the document/view architecture with Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), and presents an elaborate set of views
// for designing experiment protocols.  It also includes a number of different "output/display windows" for runtime
// display of:  eye/fixation target position, actual acquired data traces, spike histograms, and error/information
// messages.  Finally, two runtime control panels allow the user to start, stop, and sequence Maestro trials or
// continuous-stimulus runs, and a third control panel handles test & calibration of selected Maestro hardware.
//
// "MaestroDRIVER" is the runtime engine of Maestro, a driver-like RTSS process existing within a Real-Time eXtension 
// (RTX, from IntervalZero, Inc.) to Windows.  It communicates with all data acquisition and stimulus-control hardware
// used by Maestro experimental protocols.  More importantly, it configures and controls this hardware to execute the 
// protocols defined by the user on the GUI side.
//
// Naturally, these two processes must cooperate closely and share data between them.  We have elected to use a simple
// shared memory interface to implement this "interprocess communication" (IPC).  That interface is represented by the
// data structures and constants defined in this file.
//
// In addition to definitions directly related to IPC, the file also includes "cxobj_ifc.h", which provides constants
// and data structures defining the various Maestro data objects, such as targets, trials, continuous stimuli, etc.
// These are necessary so that Maestro can efficiently "download" object information to MAESTRODRIVER, which uses that 
// info to execute experimental protocols.
//
// ==> Synchronizing access to shared memory.
// Common practice in multithreading design is to use synchronization objects like semaphores, events, and mutexes to
// avoid conflicts between threads and processes accessing a shared resource.  We decided early on to avoid the use
// of these mechanisms for performance reasons -- they introduce significant overhead.  Instead, we rely on careful
// application design to avoid conflicts.  One typical technique we employ is the use of "request" and "ack" flags w/in
// the shared memory object to regulate access to other data structs within shared memory.  For example, consider the
// mechanism for posting changes in eye and fixation target position.  The position data are "gated" by two flags:
// bReqPlot is "owned" by the driver and is read-only as far as the master is concerned; bAckPlot is owned by the
// master and is read-only to the driver.  Here is how the flags are used to post an update to eye/target positions:
//
// bReqPlot       bAckPlot             Action
// --------       --------             ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//    F              F                 Idle.  Neither side is accessing position data.
//    F              F                 MAESTRODRIVER fills in the position data in preparation for an update.
//    T              F                 MAESTRODRIVER "posts" request for a plot update and continues w/ other work.
//    T              F                 Later, Maestro detects the request and begins accessing the new position data
//                                     in order to process the request.  If MAESTRODRIVER needs to post another update
//                                     during this time, it detects that a previous update is still in progress -- so
//                                     it MUST DROP the pending update.
//    T              T                 Maestro sets the "ack" flag to indicate that it has finished processing request.
//                                     Still, a new update cannot be posted, b/c the flags must be reset.
//    F              T                 MAESTRODRIVER has detected that the previous update has been serviced.  It 
//                                     resets the request flag to acknowledge this.
//    F              F                 Once it detects the request flag reset, Maestro resets its ack flag.  We're now
//                                     back to "idle", and MAESTRODRIVER is now free to post a new update.
//
// ==> The MAESTRODRIVER "stop" mutex.
// Maestro should be able to recover if MAESTRODRIVER should terminate unexpectedly, so it needs a means of detecting 
// such an occurrence.  One way to do this is to create a monitoring thread which waits indefinitely on the process 
// handle. When the process dies, the handle becomes "signaled", waking up this thread, which can then send a message 
// to the Maestro app object. But, since MAESTRODRIVER is an RTSS process -- which may NOT serve as a synchronization
// object -- we must employ a different approach:  MAESTRODRIVER immediately creates and claims a "driver-alive" mutex 
// when it starts up, and does not release it until it exits.  Shortly after spawning MAESTRODRIVER via RTSSRUN, 
// Maestro attempts to obtain a handle to that same mutex.  If successful, this mutex can serve the same purpose as the 
// process handle, as earlier described.
//
// ==> Two settings from the Maestro key in the Windows registry are passed via IPC (Sep 2019).
// Since its inception, the full pathname for the Maestro installation directory is stored in an entry under a key in 
// the HKLM node. Maestro stores the path in CXIPC.strDataPath just prior to launching CXDRIVER; CXDRIVER needs this
// path to find certain program files. See CCxMasterIO::GetHomeDirectory().
//
// In Sep 2019, a new registry entry was added that lists the busy wait times (in microseconds) for the function that
// writes commands to external latched devices via DO<15..0>: CCxEventTimer::SetDO(). Testing in the Joshua lab has
// demonstrated that a memory-mapped register write can experience a brief delay of a few microseconds. The end result
// is the sequence of steps in SetDO() -- write DO command, set DataReady=0 to latch the data, then set DataReady=1
// afterwards -- may all get executed on the hardware in rapid succession, so that a latched device could "miss" the
// command entirely. On the other hand, the Lisberger lab has not seen this issue -- perhaps due to differences in
// workstation capabilites or DIO interface capabilities. To address this problem, the user can now adjust the busy 
// wait times via the aforementioned registry entry. Maestro handles the task of reading and parsing the entry and
// storing the 3 busy wait times in CXIPC.fDOBusyWaits[].
//
// NOTE: Maestro has no need for the busy wait times; CXDRIVER should be able to read the registry entry directly
// since RTX64 supports the needed Windows registry functions in the RTSS environment. HOWEVER, when I modified 
// CXDRIVER to do so, it consistently crashed the system on the RegQueryValueEx() call. We decided to let Maestro
// handle the registry and pass the settings via IPC.
//
//
// REVISION HISTORY:
// 29mar2001-- Began development, based on the original implementation in cntrlxPC, the predecessor to CNTRLX that
//             worked in concert with a UNIX-based GUI.
// 26apr2001-- Added support for analog I/O in test mode, plus some hardware status info...
// 01may2001-- More "gate" flags for commands/requests in test mode..
// 11jun2001-- Added structures for passing commands to CXDRIVER, and responses back to CNTRLX.  These are strictly for
//             work that can be executed very quickly (w/in 20-40msec) by CXDRIVER, as CNTRLX will block upon posting
//             a command until CXDRIVER's response is received.
//          -- Rather than using dedicated space in the shared memory structure for TestMode work, we've begun
//             converting the TestMode operations into commands...
// 02aug2001-- Adding support for generating a 1Hz sine wave on a selected AO channel in TestMode: CX_TM_AOWAVE.
// 06aug2001-- Working on implementation of data trace facility...
// 24oct2001-- Some adjustments to implement eye-target position plot facility...
// 06dec2001-- Began mods to support trial-mode operations...
// 10jan2002-- Continuing mods to support trial-mode ops...
// 28feb2002-- The "die" flag in CXIPC removed.  CNTRLX tells CXDRIVER to die by issuing CX_SWITCHMODE command with the
//             mode set to CX_STOPPING.
// 26mar2002-- Added 'bChairPresent' flag to CXIPC.  If FALSE, CXDRIVER assumes animal chair is not in use, and chair
//             compensation does not take place (outside IdleMode, that is).
// 18apr2002-- Added 'bSaveSpikeTrace' flag.  If set, CXDRIVER records AI channel 15 at 25KHz; this channel is assumed
//             to carry a "spike waveform" signal (prior to spike detection circuitry) from the microelectrode.
//          -- Spike trace data will be saved in the trial data file, NOT a separat file; removed strSpksPath[].
// 18oct2002-- Added cmd CX_FIXREWSETTINGS, which sends all fixation/reward settings to CXDRIVER in any op mode except
//             TestMode.  The "reward indicator beep" enable flag is one of these settings, so CXIPC.bEnableAudio was
//             removed.  Most of the info in the CX_CM_UPDFIXREQ command was also absorbed by CX_FIXREWSETTINGS.  The
//             CX_CM_UPDFIXREQ cmd is replaced by CX_CM_UPDFIXTGTS, which is applicable only to ContMode and which
//             reports the identities of fix tgts #1 and #2 (as indices in the active tgt list).
//          -- Added field CXIPC.iNumRewards, the #rewards delivered to the animal since last reset by host.  This
//             field is incremented by CXDRIVER each time a reward is delivered.
// 13jan2003-- Modified CX_SETDISPLAY command to include additional parameters for the XY scope display.
// 14jan2003-- CX_CM_RUNSTART command modified.  No longer needs to send XY dot seed.  CCxScope handles seed generation
//             IAW current display parameters as specified in the CX_SETDISPLAY command.
// 07oct2003-- Added secondary eye position CX_EYE2 (HGPOS2, VEPOS2) to the eye-target position plot.
// 07jul2004-- Added field by which CXDRIVER reports elapsed time of the most recent trial presented, 'iLastTrialLen'.
// 10mar2005-- Added field CXIPC.iTotalRewardMS, the sum of all reward pulses (in ms) delivered since last reset by
//             host.  Will not be accurate for rigs lacking the variable reward pulse device!
// 06apr2005-- Added fields CXIPC.nSections and CXIPC.trialSections[] to communicate a trial's tagged sections to
//             CXDRIVER.  This information is stored in the data file for later use by analysis programs.
// 15jun2005-- Command CX_CM_UPDFIXTGTS extended to include index of the active target designated for tracking cursor
//             position within the eye-target plot.  CXDRIVER does not really need knowledge of the "tracking" target
//             concept, but we don't want to bypass the fact that the eye-target plot on the Maestro side reflects
//             target position AS PROVIDED BY CXDRIVER.
//          -- Added new locus CX_TRACK to the position plot facility.
// 16sep2005-- Added trial result flag bit, CX_FT_NORESP, which indicates that subject did not respond at all (right or
//             wrong) to the trial.  This applies only to staircase trials.
// 24oct2005-- Added per-trial alternate XY dot seed value, CXIPC.iXYDotSeedAlt.  If negative, it is ignored and seed
//             is controlled by display settings.  If 0, then seed will be auto-generated for current trial.  If >0,
//             then value is taken as the fixed seed for XY target random dot generation.
// 05dec2005-- Added CXIPC.fResponse and result flags in support of the new distribution-based reward contingency
//             protocol (Maestro v1.4).
// 14mar2006-- Dropped support for OKN servo, which was obsolete and never used in Maestro anyway.  Removed defined
//             constant CX_F_OKNAVAIL.
// 24mar2006-- VSG FB video replaced by the RMVideo display server. 
// 21apr2006-- Added some RMVideo display properties (screen size in pixels, frame rate, 16 vs 32bit color).
// 11dec2006-- Modified CX_CMUPDACVTGT command to include target pattern speed and direction.
// 28apr2010-- Added CXIPC.fStartPosH,V to store global target starting position offset in deg (Trial mode only).
// 24may2010-- Added CXIPC.dwTrialFlags to store flag bits from trial definition (Trial mode only).
// 27sep2011-- CX_TM_GETAI now returns some stats on the AI channel data recorded in Test mode.
// 11oct2016-- Updated constant names and various comments to reflect the fact that the RMVideo "movie store" is a
//             "media store" that can include both image and video files.
// 25oct2017-- Changes to support Windows 10/RTX64 build: There is no notion of "process slot" in RTX64, so the 
// corresponding member of the CXIPC structure is removed. Launch and termination of CXDRIVER.RTSS is handled in a
// different way in Maestro 4.x, using new RTX64 API.
// 11jun2018-- Added CXIPC.strSet[], .strSubset[] to store name of trial set and, if applicable, subset.
// 24sep2018-- Modified CX_SETDISPLAY command to include parameters governing a vertical sync spot flash on RMVideo 
// monitor -- for better sync'ing of Maestro timeline with RMVideo animation (flash is detected by photodiode, flash 
// event pulse timestamped by Maestro).
// 25sep2018-- Removed sync spot flash "margin" parameter. Feature is defined by spot's (square) size in mm and the
// flash duration in # video frames.
// 19mar2019-- Added trial result flag CX_FT_RMVDUPE, indicating that trial stopped prematurely because RMVideo 
// detected duplicate frame(s) due to a rendering delay or a delay receiving target updates from RMVideo. As of Maestro
// v4.0.5, this result is treated like CX_FT_LOSTFIX -- instead of aborting the trial sequence, the trial is repeated
// as appropriate for the current sequencing mode. Also added CXIPC.bTolRMVDuplFrame.
// 05sep2019-- Three busy wait times for CCxEventTimer::SetDO() are now stored under the Maestro key in the Windows
// registry. Maestro reads and parses the entry at startup and stores the busy wait times in CXIPC.fDOBusyWaits[] just
// before launching CXDRIVER.
// 03nov2022-- Added trial result flag CX_FT_EYELINKERR, indicating that trial stopped prematurely because of an
// error getting the next Eyelink sample (eg, sample delay too long). This result is treated like an RMVideo dupe frame
// error -- instead of aborting the trial sequence, the trial is repeated as appropriate to the sequencing mode. The
// aborted trial's data is not saved.

   // CURRENT TARGET DEFINITIONS.  Maestro is designed to store the definitions of potentially a great many distinct
   // targets.  However, when presenting a typical trial sequence or a continuous-mode run, only a small subset of

   //
   // In TrialMode, this list is initialized just prior to the start of a trial sequence, and includes all targets
   // participating in any trial from that sequence.
   //
   // In ContMode, this list is used only to define targets in the "active target list".  Active targets are generally
   // used as fixation targets in ContMode, particularly during calibration of subject's eye position.  Their positions
   // and on/off states are controlled by the CX_CM_UPDACVTGT command.
   //
   // The current target list is always read-only to MAESTRODRIVER.  Maestro "guarantees" that it will only modify the 
   // list when no protocol is running on MAESTRODRIVER, and MAESTRODRIVER only accesses the list while executing a 
   // protocol.  This should prevent any errors due to simultaneous access...

   // TRIALMODE-SPECIFIC DATA.  Defining information about a Maestro trial and participating targets.  Current usage:
   //
   // 1) Current target list is filled before a trial sequence starts.  For efficiency's sake, it includes all targets
   // used by ANY trial in the trial set from which the sequence is derived.  This is necessary to support framebuffer
   // video targets, which may take a long time to preload onto the framebuffer hardware.  If we preloaded before every
   // trial, the intertrial interval would be unacceptable.  After preparing the array, Maestro issues the command
   // CX_TR_PRELOADFB, instructing MAESTRODRIVER to preload any framebuffer targets in the array.
   // 
   //    !!!NOTE:  CX_TR_PRELOADFB is no longer issued, now that RMVideo has replaced the slow VSG framebuffer.  We 
   //    still fill the target list with all targets that participate in any trial within the set sequenced.
   //
   // 2) Before each trial is started, Maestro prepares a list of codes (see CXTRIALCODES.H) that completely defines
   // the trial and an accompanying "trial target map".  Participating targets are identified by their position in this
   // map which, in turn, points to their definitions in the loaded target list.  If the trial contains any tagged
   // sections, Maestro stores the section info here so that it can be saved in the data file.  When recorded trial
   // data is to be saved to a file, several fields in the "PROTOCOL INFO" section are also updated:  translation and
   // rotation factors used to transform target trajectories during trial code generation, full pathname of the trial
   // file in 'strDataPath' (if trial is NOT to be saved, this is NULL), and trial's name in 'strProtocol'.  Finally,
   // CX_SAVECHANS is issued to identify which ADC channels should be saved during trial, followed by CX_TR_START to
   // start the trial.
   //
   // 3) The field 'iXYDotSeedAlt' permits overriding the XY random dot seed control specified in the video display
   // settings on a per-trial basis.  If negative, it is ignored.  If 0, the seed will be auto-generated.  If positive,
   // then this value is used as the seed.  Applies only to the current trial.
   //
   // 4) Once MAESTRODRIVER starts running a trial, Maestro "guarantees" it will not change any of this info until the 
   // trial is completed.  Likewise, MAESTRODRIVER only accesses the target & trial info while it is running a trial. 
   // These "rules" ensure data integrity without the need for synch objects or handshake flags.
   //
   // 5) The "trial result" is a bit-flags field (see "PROTOCOL INFO") set by MAESTRODRIVER upon completion (or 
   // termination) of the trial.  The field is cleared (0) by MAESTRODRIVER in response to the CX_TR_START command and 
   // remains so until the trial is over.  Thus, a nonzero flag field signals MAESTRO that the trial is over and 
   // MAESTRODRIVER has returned to the intertrial "idle" state of TrialMode.
