 cxdevicemgr.cpp : Implementation of class CCxDeviceMgr, MaestroRTSS's "device manager".

 AUTHOR:  saruffner

 DESCRIPTION:
 The purpose of MaestroRTSS's abstract hardware interface framework is to allow an application to work with ANY device
 for which there exists a suitable interface implementation, without "having to know" which kind of device is installed 
 in the system. Then how does the app find and "attach" to the device? This task is handled by the device manager, 
 CCxDeviceMgr. This class is necessarily "aware" of the different abstract interfaces and the available realizations of 
 each interface. During startup, the device manager tries to find in the system a physical device  that implements one 
 (or more) of the desired hardware functions (AI, AO, DIO event-timer, RMVideo, and XYScope). Once found, the manager 
 instantiates the device object for that particular board and attempts to "open" and initialize the device. The manager 
 maintains all acquired device objects and provides access to each via pointer -- cast to the abstract interface class 
 (CCxAnalogIn, etc). The application can then use the base interface pointer to access the hardware functionality 
 without knowing which supported device is being used.

 What if a supported device is NOT found in the system for a particular hardward function? Rather than returning a NULL
 pointer, CCxDeviceMgr returns a pointer to a "placeholder" implementation of the hardware interface. This placeholder 
 is a lightweight implementation of the interface representing the **absence** of that hardware function. Essentially, 
 calling any placeholder method will have no effect and, where appropriate, will return an error indication. Why do 
 this? So that we do not have to check for NULL pointers before calling interface methods.

 ==> Usage.
 Construct the CCxDeviceMgr object, then invoke Startup() to connect to all available MaestroRTSS hardware devices
 installed in the host machine. MaestroRTSS requires only once instance for each hardware device function, and 
 CCxDeviceMgr enforces this fact by preventing multiple attachments. If a device of a particular interface class is not 
 found, CCxDeviceMgr creates a suitable "no device found" placeholder object. To access a particular device object, use 
 the inline methods GetTimer(), GetAI(), etc. Finally, call Shutdown() to release all allocated device resources when 
 they are no longer needed.

 ==> Exception to the rule: CCxRMVideo.
 The OpenGL application RMVideo was developed to replace the antiquated VSG2/4 framebuffer video board. RMVideo runs on
 a separate Linux workstation and communicates with MaestroRTSS over a private, dedicated Ethernet link.  While it is
 treated as a "device" from MaestroRTSS's standpoint, there is only one realization. CCxRMVideo serves as the concrete 
 interface with RMVideo; there is no abstract interface.

 ==>Target devices supported.
 1) CM62Timer -- DIO event timer realization on the TIC6x DSP-based M62 baseboard from Innovative Integration, Inc.
 2) CLisTechTimer -- DIO event timer realization on Lisberger Technologies' ISA-based, 16-input timestamping board.
 3) CPciMio16E1 -- AI realization on the PCI-MIO-16E1 16-channel, 12-bit MIO board from National Instruments.
 4) CUeiPD2AO8 -- AO realization on the 8-channel, 16-bit PD2-AO-8/16 board from United Electronics Industries.
 5) CNatlInstATAO10 -- AO realization on the 10-channel, 12-bit AT-AO-10 ISA board from National Instruments.
 6) CXYDetroit -- XYScope device realization using the TIC6x-based "Detroit" DSP from SSP, Inc.
 7) CXYDakar -- XYScope device realization using the TIC44-based "Dakar F5 Carrier" DSP from SSP, Inc.
 8) CCxRMVideo -- handles communication with RMVideo over a private, dedicated Ethernet link using RTX TCP/IP.
 9) CNI6363 -- The PCIe-6363 MIO board from National Instruments. Support introduced in Maestro 3; in fact, this board
 is intended to serve as 3 devices in one -- handling AI, AO, and the DIO event timer functions. This is possible 
 because the AI, AO and DIO subsystems on the PCIe-6363 can all work independently. CNI6363 implements CDevice for the 
 PCIe-6363; it is created to acquire and initialize the board. If successful, CNI6363 constructs and provides access to 
 three "pseudo-subdevice" objects implementing the three hardware functions. Each of these subdevice objects wraps the 
 original CNI6363 parent device object, and their CDevice methods related to acquiring/releasing the hardware are
 essentially no-ops.


 REVISION HISTORY:
 18jun2002-- Created. CCxDeviceMgr is the "device manager" for CXDRIVER. It encapsulates knowledge of all realized
    implementations of the CXDRIVER abstract hardware interfaces, and it handles the task of creating the device 
    "object" associated with each physical device.  Also defined in the module are "no device found" placeholder 
    implementations for each of the abstract hardware interfaces.
 09jan2003-- Integrated XY scope device interface CCxScope and its available realizations.
 24jan2003-- Integrated OKNDRUM PID servo controller interface CCxServo and its available realization CDC2PC100.
 23apr2003-- Integrated framebuffer video device interface CCxFrameBuf and its available realization for the VSG2/4.
          -- Moved "null" placeholder device classes to their respective device interface class declarations.
          -- Now that the framebuffer device has been incorporated into the device manager framework, we can now further
    isolate the process of attaching to CXDRIVER hardware. The AttachTo***() methods are now private, and all device 
    attachments are handled in the new method Startup(). New inline methods GetTimer(), GetAI(), etc expose the device 
    objects to CCxDriver.
 30apr2003-- Startup() now takes a pointer to the Maestro interface object CCxMasterIO so it can post progress messages 
    during device object creation.
 29dec2003-- Startup() sets the "device install path" (CDevice::SetInstallPath()) IAW the home directory provided by
    CCxMasterIO::GetHomeDirectory(). This is part of the mechanism for making the MaestroGUI/MaestroRTSS installation 
    relocatable.
 14mar2006-- As of Maestro v1.5.0, the OKNDRUM target is no longer supported. CCxDeviceMgr modified accordingly.
 24mar2006-- Removed CCxFrameBuf from MAESTRODRIVER. Replaced by CCxRMVideo, the interface to the remote video 
    application RMVideo.  CCxRMVideo is a concrete interface -- there will be no "alternate" realizations.
 16jun2011-- Begun changes for Maestro 3. Support old hardware, while adding support for the NI PCIe-6363, a multi-
    function IO board that should be able to handle AI, AO, and DIO eventtimer functions. This "breaks the mold" of the 
    CDevice-based class framework, however, since one real device is handling the work of three conceptual devices....
 05jul2011-- Dropped support for CXYDaytona. This implementation of CCxScope on Spectrum Signal Processing's Daytona
    C6x board was never successfully completed. Since the XYScope is on its way out (can't find large analog XY 
    oscilloscopes any more!), there's no point.
 20mar2012-- Moved calls to WSAStartup() and WSACleanup() from CCxRMVideo to CCxDeviceMgr:Startup() and Shutdown(). 
    These methods connect/disconnect the calling RTSS process to the RTX TCP-IP stack and should be invoked only once 
    per process.
 07nov2017-- Mods to fix compilation issues in VS2017 for Win10/RTX64 build. NOTE that the following legacy boards will 
 not be supported in this build (Maestro "4.x"): LisTech timer board, m62 timer impl, PCIMIO16E1, ATAO10, and PD2AO8.
 11jun2018-- XYScope display support DROPPED. The XYScope hardware boards -- Detroit C6x and Dakar -- are conventional
 PCI boards, and conventional PCI slots are no longer provided on new workstations. Therefore, Maestro 4 does NOT 
 support the XYScope display. However, we elected to leave all XYScope-related code in place, in case the platform is
 somehow revived in a future release. The AttachToXYScopeDev() method merely creates the placeholder null device and 
 reports that XYScope hardware support is not available.
