Serves as the local repository for the code bases for Maestro, RMVideo, and related Matlab utilities. I created it so that I can backup all of
the code to a remote repo in my personal GitHub account.

If I do any further development of any of these applications, I should update the build infrastructure -- specifically, the Visual Studio settings on the
Windows workstation for compiling Maestro -- to use the code files here.
