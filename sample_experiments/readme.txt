This folder contains a number of sample Maestro experiment documents that have been used over the years to test new 
features as they were introduced, to verify operation of a new release, and so on.

The file testing411.cxe is the primary experiment document I've used for testing Maestro 4.x, while testing500.cxe 
serves the same purpose for Maestro 5.x. Much of the content in the two documents is similar -- except that all XYScope 
targets (and the trials/stimulus runs that used the XYScope) have been removed from testing500.cxe. The XYScope display 
platform has been unsupported since Maestro 4.0 and was removed entirely in Maestro 5.0.

The files InstructionMagnitudeSingleTrial.jmx and testJMXV110.jmx were created by Maestro users. They are examples of 
the alternative JSON experiment document format, which can be reviewed and edited in a text editor (the .cxe files are 
an opaque binary format). They're here primarily so we can verify future Maestro releases can still open them.

testJMXV110.jmx contains trial sets using the XYScope and another using RMVideo. It was imported into Maestro 5.0, which 
removed all XYScope-related stuff, then saved as assessRF.cxe.

The file examplemdoc.jmx is the JMX document generated by the sample MATLAB script examplemdoc.m, which demonstrates
how to use the MATLAB utility maestrodoc(). This particular file was generated using v1.2.2 of maestrodoc() and 
includes two trials that define and employ random variables, which was not possible with previous versions of the
utility. Maestro 5.0.2 and later can import JMX documents that include trials with random variables.
